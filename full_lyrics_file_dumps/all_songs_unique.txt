Yeah, man!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!

She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!

The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
I'm in love with you!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
You must think I'm crazy!

Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
They got away!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!

Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
How they ever flood my soul!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, no!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!

Woo-hoo!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Goodnight!
I've got the freight train blues!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Them Reds did it!
Oh!

Alright!
I wanna be yours!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Oh, yeah!

And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
I'll see her soon, I know."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
I'll bring back my lady."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"

You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
For that reason I will have to stay."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"That way down Highway 61."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
We'll both go home together."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
So write to her tenderly."
From across that lonesome ocean."
They look as white as snow."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
And hung on a willow tree."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
That you must always first forgive them."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
We'll both go off together."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I love far better than thee."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
You must know about my debutante."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Tangled up in blue."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
We want folksingers here."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
"I've had too much of your company,"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Come flowing down so free?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Country'll grow."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
"Is it easy to forget?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
And punched my cigarette."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
I would want again tomorrow."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
It's all for the love of thee."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Where you and I will unite."
Have it on Highway 61."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
You can't blame me at all."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
But I know what you want."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I'll endow them onto thee."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
He said, "Tell me about it."
They look as dark as night."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
And keep him good company."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
You and I'll never know."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Will mourn for your return."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
I didn't see you around."
You can't blame us at all."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
Get on your horse and ride away."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
I can't find my knees."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
And have it on Highway 61."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Would kill a little bird like me."
And pretend that you never have met."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
You made it there somehow,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I can make it through,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
China doll, alcohol,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
You have given me life to live,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Eh, in somebody's room,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Don't tie no bows,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I went down to scrub and rub,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
I have no one to meet,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
How he died nobody could say,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
And gathering storms may arise,
Father of air and father of trees,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
They pass by so silently,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Says he's got a bad bill,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Give you my money, honey,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
You better chew gum,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Stripping away at it all,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Don't let me drift too far,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
By rivers of blindness,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
I've been all around the world, boys,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
They keep it all hid,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Ye shall be changed,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
So I got those worries blues,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Is looking for a new fool,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Precious angel under the sun,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Out to the windy beach,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
You broke a heart that loved you,
He got that soft, silky skin,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
God knows there's a purpose,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
The light I never knowed,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
I can see the turning of the key,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
And to come each time you call,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Baby, let me follow you down,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
That foreign sound in your ear,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
People going down to the ground,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
People talk over situations,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
We'll go someplace unknown,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Tell her not to worry,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
We never much thought we could get very old,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
True love, they've been without it,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Icicles hanging down,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Go melt back in the night,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
And point away from the past,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
You married young just like your ma,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
And the whole world is on your case,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Yes, I want you so bad,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Like some mystery,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
God knows it's a crime,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
She would have married me,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
All you can do is do what you must,
Well, I can't understand,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Without a love of my own,
I'm never, never far from home,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
But now morning is clear,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
If anything is gonna sell,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
I can't cross the line, you know,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
It always has hit me from below,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Every brain is civilized,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Living in the land of Nod,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Get back, write Braille,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Saved,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Tell me that you love me only,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
And there's two white horses following me,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
I'd be sad and blue,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
They say that every man must fall,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
In a pine box for all eternity,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Yet every distance is not near,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
If you can't quit your sinning,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Advertising signs, they con,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
If she ain't feeling well,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Automobile coming into style,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Up and down the block,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Madams light the candles,
In the shadows of moonlight,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I been good,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
In love and with kindness,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Staying far behind without you,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
They say every man need protection,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
They walk among the stately trees,
Far away in the stormy night,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Far away from it all,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
The day you quit me, baby,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
In the great unknown,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
You need something to open up a new door,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Searching everywhere I know,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Better jump down a manhole,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
A man with a badge skips by,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
If'n you don't know by now,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Where mercy walks the plank,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Never weak, but always strong,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Without your sweet love,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
But, if you want me to,
Get born, keep warm,
Go away from my window,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
They tell me every man must fall,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Relationships of ownership,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
It's really something,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
And forget my pride,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Heart of mine, go back home,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
They say everything can be replaced,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Three angels up above the street,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
For something that he never done,
Don't let her hear,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I been riding the midnight train,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Six months on the chain gang,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Three by three they're turning the key,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
God knows how to make it flow,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Into my own parade,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Don't matter what you did,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
God knows there's a river,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Got my mind made up,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
That her father was going to hang,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
True love of mine,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Stay away from the train line,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
That can do what's never been done,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Memory, ecstasy,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Well, I'm so glad,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Every moon is so sanctified,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
But it ain't him to blame,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
This situation can only get rougher,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
But the bottles are done,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Front door shut, back door too,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
A true love of mine,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
You had enough of hatred,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Is it really any wonder,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Going home,
I just can't do what I've done before,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
My senses have been stripped,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Make you spin or do you in,
Is used, it is plain,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
You can raise up your right hand,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
And, although that we're single and free,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
And here I sit so patiently,
It was a girl I learned it from,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Look who's back in town,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
God knows you ain't pretty,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Never did feel this way before,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
I like the cool way you look at me,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
See her in that very tight skirt,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
I'm pledging my time to you,
The night would see me wide awake,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Laying low,
My love, she speaks softly,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
If ever I prove false to you,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
You wanna drown love,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
God knows you've got to weep,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
On this new morning, new morning,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Just like a rolling stone,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
As his youth now unfolds,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Speaking to some French girl,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I got the worried blues,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Till both of us fell by the way,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Oh, watered-down love,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Don't ever try to change me,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Adiós, mi corazón,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Where I will always be renewed,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Oxford Town around the bend,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
I got my mind made up,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
To strict party-platform ties,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
I know I can't win,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
This place ain't doing me any good,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Don't let her see,
To be––direction home,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I bless the day I found you,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I went into the city, into the town,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
A complete unknown,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Oh, singing just for you,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Well, the job that you used to have,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
But, if I will save you the time,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
To hang and to lynch,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Something about you that I can't shake,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
That fellow who never blushes,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Ah, get sick, get well,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Most of the time it's well understood,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
And also by his feet,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
You want watered-down love,
"Not me," said his manager,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Face full of black soot,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Or select you or dissect you,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I get my sweet reward,
But he's the property of Jesus,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
The beat is pumping,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
We'll fly the night away,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
No, nothing was delivered,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Dust on my face and my cape,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
The winter would hold no spring,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Just don't know what to do,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
All them prophets good and gone,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Father of night, father of day,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Hmm, I can make it through,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
They lowered him down as a king,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
But, deep inside my heart,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Light yourself a candle,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Of this I can't say very much,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
My limbs are shaking,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Yes, I'm so glad,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Too serious to fool,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
We take great delight in our own company,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
To shine in through,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
He's not selling any alibis,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
So unknown,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
I'm so glad,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
But I'm pressing on,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
It always means so much,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
A dream about you, baby,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
And, if I see the day,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Father of minutes, father of days,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Forever young, forever young,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
In the darkness of my night,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
King of the streets, child of clay,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
All that and more and then some,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
We live in a political world,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Far past the frozen leaves,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
If you'd see me this a-way,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
To be out on your own,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
He won't do nothing to you,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
You follow, find yourself at war,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
I don't care if you feel like me,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Waiting for the trains,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Private reasons, great or small,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
And the table's full and overflowed,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
I couldn't see where we were going,
May be living in another country under another name,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Like as not, it's better so,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
That must be what it's all about,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
I would not feel so all alone,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
I'm going down the river,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
To keep up his hate,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
How many a year has passed and gone,
And I'm just like that bird,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
You need something to open your eyes,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
They say every man must fall,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Joey, Joey,
Courage is a thing of the past,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
At the close of the day,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
They must bust in early May,
To know how much I really care,
Going, going,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
You'll change your last name, too,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Want you so bad,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
The country doctor rambles,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
In the hills of mystery,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
But, if I can save you any time,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
And your streets are getting empty,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
And may you stay forever young,
God knows there's a chance,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Don't put yourself over the line,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
With a killer's pride, security,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Thank You, Lord,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Drag you down or drain you down,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Someone to open each and every door,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
There's always someone who understands,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
They say every man must need protection,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Father of cold and father of heat,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Strike another match, go start anew,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Newspapermen eating candy,
And think they're fooling you,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Look out, kid,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
For the politician's gain,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
I need a shot of love,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I love you, pretty baby,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Hold me, baby, be near,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I rambled out of New York town,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
A thousand miles from home,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
You say my kisses are not like his,
I once held her in my arms,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Father of loneliness and pain,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
You got to serve somebody,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
She never does me wrong,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
I've been around this whole country,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
How he died nobody can say,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
You stole her love from me one day,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
You have given everything to me,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
You got something better,
You have given all there is to give,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
You gotta look some other place,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
I don't want to meet your kin,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
God knows it's terrifying,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
But ye shall be a-changed,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
And she aches just like a woman,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
She'll surely turn to white,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
To be one your own,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
God don't call it treason,
Get jailed, jump bail,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Went back home to the yard,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Each time we meet, love,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
You even make love just like a woman,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
The path you've endured has been rough,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
He's the property of Jesus,
For all intended purposes,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
You can run down to the desert,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
I want my arms around you,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Well, I may just swear,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Carry the New York Times,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Thinking about the government,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
I went into the red, went into the black,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
When I seen him lose control,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
With the juice running down my leg,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
I went out last night to take a little round,
And come every time you call,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
He's young and on fire,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Wasn't making any great connection,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
You and me, we had completeness,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
And I'm in the shade,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
I shall be released,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Don't wear sandals,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
And furnish me with tape,
Spent my money on you, honey,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
People talk of situations,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I got a bird that whistles,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
And rivers that ran through every day,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
You will be alright, girl,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
You better duck down the alleyway,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
How many times have you heard someone say,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
With his fist in a clinch,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Watch the plain-clothes,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
I just keep pressing on,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Wintertime in New York town,
Said I'm pressing on,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
It's rising up above my head,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
And you take just like a woman,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
But the time ain't tall,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Paradise, sacrifice,
I got those worried blues,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
She's crying like an evil stone,
If you'd see me this way,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
And not going through any great extreme,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Where the neon madmen climb,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
When she lays upon the grass,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Where life and death are memorized,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Thieving in the alley,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
No direction home,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
The Second World War came to an end,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
In the ruins of your balcony,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
My dear, sweet friend,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Like you never did before,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Broken hands on broken plows,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Watered-down love,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
When there is no more,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
I can change, I swear,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
With no direction home,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
And I got the worried blues,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Precious father, loving mother,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Of ancient history,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
The day would surely have to break,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
My existence led by confusion boats,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Serve somebody,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
A hand set the spark,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
May be an actor in a plot,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Since you've been gone,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
In the end,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
God knows it's fragile,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I just don't see why I should even care,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Human gods aim for their mark,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Some things are too hot to touch,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Hazel, you called and I came,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
People carry roses,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I threw it all away,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
And all of your children start to resent you,
She leave by the other and roam,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
I just say no thanks,
Don't let me change my heart,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
You can hear them tires squeal,
To have––be on your own,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Don't you tell Henry,
And I got those worried blues,
And played the fife lowly,
I thank the Lord,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
I think we better talk this over,
We've killed each one,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
To find out if she's talked,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
She said she would always stay,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Who will promise never to part,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Aim well, my little one,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
For she ain't the same,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
One by one they followed the sun,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
And I'm back in the rain,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
That five walls cannot hide him,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
And to come every time you call,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
For his age he is wise,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
First degree and second degree,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I march in the parade of liberty,
To be on your own,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Carved next to his name,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
In his anger and his shame,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Don't know what to do without it,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Had no one to go my bail,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
I landed up on the downtown side,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
You don't have to feed me,
Well, there ain't no going back,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
If you throw it all away,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Why she did go,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
All I really wanna do,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
You've got to serve somebody,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Eh, see what you can do,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
And on the highway of regret,
Corrina, Corrina,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
But something has changed,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
But evidently she don't,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
You don't want a love that's pure,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
When all will be well,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
To be alone with you,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
To be without a home,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Don't follow leaders,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
You have given me eyes to see,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Mercury, gravity,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Each one playing a horn,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Over the hills and far away,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
"Not I," said the referee,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
You got something I want plenty of,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Drifting too far from shore,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
That you'd have liked me to,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
But it would not be new,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
A foreign sound to your ear,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
I'd already gone the distance,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
You have explained every mystery,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Like a rolling stone,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
It hurts me, too,
Not the end, not the end,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Got me a secret membership card,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
You were snow, you were rain,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
By losers, cheaters,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Equality, liberty,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
The kingdoms of experience,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
To stay closer than any friend,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
He been around the world and back again,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Loyalty, unity,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
I just can't beg you anymore,
But he can't be blamed,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Beyond here lies nothing,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
But it ain't me, babe,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Come all without, come all within,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
I had so much left to do,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Don't let her know,
You're beautiful to me,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
They run a brick and tile company,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
God sees it all unfold,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Or have done something wrong,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
And, if I can save you any time,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
God don't call it wrong,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
To your tambourine in time,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Circled by the circus sands,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Keep me where you are,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Precious memories, how they linger,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Made of silver or of golden,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
I got no place left to turn,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
In the turning of twilight,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Read books, repeat quotations,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
That long, black train is pulling down,
It could even be like a myth,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Holding his club like he was a king,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
I try my best to be just like I am,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Look away, you rolling river,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
I want you,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
She'll be coming forth,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
I should have left this town this morning,
Need a woman all the time,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
She's the worst you could ever have,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
For her to arrive,
Eh, singing just for you,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Baby, please stop crying,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Just like I did before,
Badge out, laid off,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Using every angle under the sun,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
I wish I a-was a magician,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
The Communists was a-coming around,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Can't find what I need,
My arms and legs were broken,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
I got a wife and five little children,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
To protect his white skin,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
So many roads, so much at stake,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
The sky too is folding over you,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
A million faces at my feet,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
While riding on a train going west,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
But you're doing it again,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Well, I don't mind dying,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
When I was in Missouri,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
We live and we die, we know not why,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
My woman needs it every day,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
To a solid rock,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Oh, see what you can do,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
She said she would never forget,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
God knows it's outta sight,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Without ideals or violence,
Father of day, father of night,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Hmm, see what you can do,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
I been good while I been waiting,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Yesterday is just a memory,
The human mind can only stand so much,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
But I will be back, I will survive,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
And it's like I ain't here,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
All the silver, all the gold,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Watching the river flow,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
You could look at it and weep,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
She once was a true love of mine,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
That they do not respect in any degree,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Read books and repeat quotations,
I'd give you the sky high above,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Nothing was delivered,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Friends with you,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
May you stay forever young,
The carpet too is moving under you,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Under the microscope,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
But I'm saved,
Searching high, searching low,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
She got great big hind legs,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
The wind blowing the snow around,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
It was from her ship sailing,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
I got two white horses following me,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Yes, and I'll go last,
The only son of God Almighty,
That fired the gun,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
From their fates try to resign,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
It still ain't me, babe,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Bring the wife and family,
And you make love just like a woman,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
When you think that you've lost everything,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Made before the foundation of the world,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Try hard, get barred,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
I wish tonight were here,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
You will search, babe, at any cost,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
She's opened up a happy home,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Love that's pure no accident,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Want you,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
So glad,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Father of black, father of white,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
If not for you,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
On the stone that remains,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
A handle hid out in the dark,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Just then the order came to charge,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
That one doctor cannot save him,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Trust yourself,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Going,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Says he's got a bad cough,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Like a complete unknown,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
There she come, now, down my way,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Every head is so dignified,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
And give him back the time he's done,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
New morning,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Tell me,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I just don't know what to do,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
But you were gambling for support,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
I want you so bad,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Keep a clean nose,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
The night blows cold and rainy,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
In the lonely night,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
If you must cling to someone,
I try my best to be like I am,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
But you try with your whole soul,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
The air is getting hotter,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
So, never leave me lonely,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
But I've been hanging on,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
But I know that he don't talk,
Better jump down the manhole,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
The one we can see and can feel,
The sky too is folding under you,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
One by one until there were none,
"Come along and take a trip,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
I had no one for to go my bail,
As the daylight hours do increase,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
The man in the trench-coat,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
The midnight rain follows the train,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
They say every distance is not near,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
God knows everything,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
One by one they follow the sun,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Heart of mine, be still,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Over your senses you have no control,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Yes, I'm pressing on,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
God knows it's true,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
And, though the line is cut,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Trouble,
Pressing on,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
I can't understand,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
God knows that, when you see it,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Who could they get to carry you,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Winter would have no spring,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Seven days,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
With what your fate is going to be,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Couldn't even see the floor,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Heart of mine,
In the instant that I preach,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Going, going, gone,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I'll be on my way,
By users, cheaters,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
It's a price I have to pay,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
The night passed away so quickly,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
The wind howls like a hammer,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
God knows there's a heaven,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Four by four, no illusion for,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
I run right home and I went to bed,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
You were striped, you were plain,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Nothing too very scientific,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
God knows it's a struggle,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Don't try No Doz,
I had a dream about you, baby,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
One summer's day he came passing by,
And I'm so glad,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Dream about you, baby,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Don't steal, don't lift,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Watch the river flow,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
I'd only have to stay,
The angels play on their horns all day,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I never can go because, you know,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
He is centuries old,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
To be so useless and all,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
And I––I walk out on my own,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
I don't care if you analyze me,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Ever since I been a child,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Well, the way I love that woman,
As the present now will later be past,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Stand up straight and tall,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Someone to close his heart,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Mixing up the medicine,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
I won't have my nature way,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
It's alright,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Silvio, I gotta go,
But I would not feel so all alone,
While paupers change possessions,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Yesterday's just a memory,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
For the wise men and the fools,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
It was you who came right through,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
See you fly or watch you die,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
This world is ruled by violence,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Simplify you, classify you,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
That the laws are with him,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Love don't have any place,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
In the little church a-this side of town,
In one the surface was frozen,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Day you quit me, baby,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Far away and over the wall,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
You always responded when I needed your help,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
How does it feel,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
And, if anybody asks me,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
They don't believe in mercy,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
And you know I could never be your own,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
And pretend that we never have touched,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Without a dream in my heart,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Well, get sick, get well,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
And the point is slick,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Seem like I been down this way before,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
More people kept a-piling on,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
To gather flowers constantly,
Gonna serve somebody,
I'm going out of my mind,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Try to be a success,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Grandpa died last week,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Well, well, well,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Stone you and say good luck,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Oh, Angelina,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Honey, just for you to climb,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Bringing me all of your charms,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Like a dog on a chain,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
It don't matter what you did,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
They took a clean-cut kid,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Strangers all give me the news,
Only one thing I did wrong,
The joint is jumping,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Don't let yourself fall,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Vanished from my hand,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
I can't be good, baby,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Looking for a new fool,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Ain't no going back,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
And it ain't me, babe,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
They––they show me to the door,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Broken switches, broken gates,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
You to me were true,
When the night comes falling,
But, to remain as friends,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
They say every man needs protection,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Socialism, hypnotism,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Well, I'm pressing on,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
The country music station plays soft,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
I don't wanna fake you out,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
And she'll be coming forth,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
It's too bad he had to go,
God knows when,
It's like I ain't here,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Resent him to the bone,
Just to know that you are near,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Hang around the ink-well,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
If I didn't have to guess,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Go down to the river, babe,
Looking 'bout the government,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
I'm leaving today,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Too noble to neglect,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
The answer is blowing in the wind,
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Democracy don't rule the world --
That's where you belong --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
My baby told me I would have to go.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
And come away with me.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I got trouble in my mind.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
When I paint my masterpiece.
"And light on my right knee.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Honey, I never would have come.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
That I really did try to get close to you.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
I'll only let you down.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
A true love of mine.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Got to have done some evil deed.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
With your golden loom.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Broken voices on broken phones.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
I just can't see through it anymore.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
But I can't get close to her at all.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
While evening slips away.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
Chain you down or be your clown.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Havanageeluh.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
By the jealousy of others around her.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Don't remember one thing more.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
I didn't feel so cold then.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
Or define you or confine you.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
I needed somebody to talk to.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
From the little Minnesota town.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I threw it all away.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
When my working day's through.
And I'll rock you too.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
But you're never sure why you're here.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
And ye shall be a-changed.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
But the fighter still remains.
To reach of your rattling drums.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Feel further away than ever before.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
Come on, darling.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
But I would never do you wrong.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.

When someone disappears, you never even know.
To live it you had to explode.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Orders from the D.A.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Patriotism, materialism.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.

Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.

If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.

She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.

I was looking around, I was outta sight.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
You got it, baby.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
I'd give anything to be with you.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Throw my ticket out the window.
I couldn't see what you could show me.

About an old man that never done wrong.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Tell me that it isn't true.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
My mind is breaking.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
Evidently she won't.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.

Valentines can't buy her.
But that's what I am paid to do.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Thought I was a communist.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
And disregards the rest.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
If you just let me come home with you.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.

A lover for your life and nothing more.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
God knows...
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
And watch the parking meters.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
The whole world is my throne.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
"And stay all night with me.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
But it was more than I could do.
And I want you to be that woman.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Memories of what used to be.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
The light I never knowed.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
See that my grave is kept clean.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
That linger in the fireball heat.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Just you and me.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
He never did know what it was all about.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
Gonna serve somebody.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
The National Guard stands around the door.
Friends with you.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
Honey, baby.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
And the morning will be breaking.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Now they say it's the land of money.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Under the hedges.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
And discovered her invisible self.
People bending broken rules.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
I had something to protect.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Greenwich Village.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
That big, old boat started to sink.
As if a wedding vow.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
I's looking around just to see myself.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
I'd like to know.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
I'm just average, common too.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
When my memory is not so short.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Go lightly on the ground.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
That keep us so tightly bound.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
And you must realize the danger.
I'm younger than that now.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
The sooner you can go.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
But I ain't got Corrina.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Leading me, going home.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.

And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
The National Guard stands around his door.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
But with the country to where you're going.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
The night will soon be gone.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
So, darling, you better come through.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
To hold me in your arms.
You can make it too.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
You are on the bottom.
You're my baby.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
The words that her lover had said.
Until I threw it all away.
To the old folks' home and the college.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Everything is broken.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
Father of love and father of rain.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.

When he played and we didn't dance.
That must be what it's all about.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Crying out that he was framed.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Good as I been to you.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
My love winks, she does not bother.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Bring that bottle over here.
I will only let you down.
At the end of the trail.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
Mortality, reality.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
You don't have to worry any more.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
When you made everybody pay.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
When you go your way and I go mine.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
I see better days and I do better things.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
Please quit your low-down ways.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
In the pale moonlight.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
Her fond face pale with woe.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
I scarcely feel the glow.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Is gonna be against the law.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
Without ideals or violence.
Far down the street we stray.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
You sound like a hillbilly.
We all know for sure that it's real.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Rain would gather, too.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
At my window with a broken wing.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Take it on down to give me grow.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Slowly into autumn.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
But you break just like a little girl.
Like you never done before.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
It's that million dollar bash.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
Of every man who put me here.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Suffering like a fool.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Baby, please come home.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Looking for a new friend.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
The same as my father before him.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Got ice water in my veins.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
Yes, tell me.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
You want a watered-down love.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Never will want for money.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Oh, Angelina.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Trying to create a next world war.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
High society, notoriety.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
And each one I've never seen again.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
It only brings me sorrow.
For that's the way I remember her best.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
68, but says he's 24.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
I had so little time to fail.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
That's the day you die.
And there's no time to think.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The place that I started from.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
I don't know.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
And every window made of glass.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Come on, baby...
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
She said she would always stay.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Blood on your saddle.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
On the caboose of the train.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
I can't see through it anymore.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Means another poor boy is underground.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Under the midnight moon.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
And try to avoid the scandals.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
I shall be released.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Headed out for the western skies.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
In the brightness of my day.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
Hoping you'll come through too.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
If I ride back again.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
To see that you're madly in love.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
"Get well, get well," said she.
That's the way I remember her best.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
Magic in a magical land.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
Watch the parking meters.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
It was all over by a quarter past.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
Hope you're ready.
Some place so high above the wall.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Some place so high above this wall.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Trust yourself.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Even before you came in the door.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
The country doctor rambles.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Now and forever let it be me.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
Oh, convey herself away.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Everybody that was hanging out.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Honey, come and see about me.
And ye shall be changed.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
And then go on home and have my fun.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Gal, you're on my mind.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
To know which way the wind blows.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
I never saw the man again.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
You only got ten.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
And he was a friend of mine.
Put me outta doors.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Hope that it don't sleet.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
You know, I loved her just the same.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
With gold and silver in her hand.
And left me here facing the wall.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Unless they're from another world.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
And it never seemed strange.
And the night blows rainy.
While the law looks the other way.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Wants to get it paid off.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
I want you.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Even the softest touch.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Saying wants company.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.

I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
Who says she knows me well.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
For as long as love will last.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
It'll never do, somehow.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
People sleeping in broken beds.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
You'll do as much for me.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
With all these promises you left for me.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Join the army if you fail.
I see that stationmaster too.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
She acts like we never met.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
And that failure's no success at all.
And the mailbox is locked.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
I long to reach for you in the night.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
There's no words that need to be said.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
In the palace of the Pope.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
What some people are gonna do for money.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Got my mind made up.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Behind a man's brain.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
No kindred or relative nigh.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Hear me singing through these tears.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Just remember that death is not the end.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
She once was a true love of mine.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
It don't matter anyhow.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
You were always so close and still within reach.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
If'n you don't know by now.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Hmm.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
To be alone with you.
In an oil refinery.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
To anything I might've tried.
And you only got ten.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Drink up your blood like wine.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
When I run outta things to investigate.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
68, but says she's 24.
Duality, mortality.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
They want me for a gambling fight.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
You cast your spell and I went under.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Mama, you are on my mind.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
From my toes up to my ears.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Turned on my record player.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
Everybody must get stoned.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Man is opposed to fair play:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
But there's one promise, darling:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Till I come into New York town:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Serve somebody:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
His epitaph plain:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
I find complete love;
Some speak of the future;
Make promises by the hour;
Had to be held down by big police;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
So many things that we never will undo;
Crumble into one another;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
All lies and jest;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<p>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
But am I still dreaming yet?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
How many compared to yesterday?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Oh, so why not you and me?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Are you the same person that was here before?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Where did you hide your halo?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
So I can know if I'm really real?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
When he's standing in front of you?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Before he can see the sky?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
For all these earthly things?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Gal, where you been so long?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Before it is washed to the sea?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Too many people have died?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Has anybody seen my love?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
How's everything in heaven?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
How could they ever mistake you?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Before he can hear people cry?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Baby, can I come home with you?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
What good am I?
And one deserving of affection?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Before you call him a man?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
How can you say he will haunt you?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
To love and follow His direction?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
How much poison did they inhale?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Can you get back in?
How could they let you go?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Why would I want to take your life?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Across the swamp of time?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Does anyone even try?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Baby, what more can I tell?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
When did you leave heaven?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
How does it feel?
Am I ready?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Did you respect me for what I did?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
What's wrong with you this time?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Who you thought you were talking to?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
How can I live for You?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Like a rolling stone?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Before they're forever banned?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Oh, where are you tonight?
How many more without any reward?
By golly, what more can I say?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
How many more can they afford?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Must everybody bow?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Baby, can't you tell?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
What else can a poor boy do?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Don't you remember making baby love?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
What can I do for You?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Where did you lose your wings?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Of everything you see?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Why and what's the reason for?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Are you ready?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
And how does it feel?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Just like a rolling stone?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
What can I give to You?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Have they missed you?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Across the swooping plain?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
That too many people have died?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
What would life be?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Can I come home with you?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
What do you think about that, my friend?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
And things would be different the next time we wed
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
We live in a political world
As I stand upon the sand
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And those whom doom and death had spared
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Many times I've often prayed
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
I'll always thank the Lord
Things would be different the next time we wed
You used to be so amused
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
But now something has changed
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
It's something you did
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
He was a clean-cut kid
Maybe someday you will understand
I want you, baby, just to understand
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
How many times can a man turn his head
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Somebody seen him hanging around
Just what you had in mind
But all that suffering was not to be compared
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
I thought that it was well-understood
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Nothing was delivered
There ain't nothing in this world
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
She let go of my hand
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
They took a clean-cut kid
You used––be so proud
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Silvio, silver and gold
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
So I'll make my stand
But something has changed
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And into the path you are hurled
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
And then you told me later as I apologized
Now, a very great man once said
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Standing on the water, casting your bread
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
But she ain't gonna find the road
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
"Equality". I spoke the word
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
I live in another world
I've been walking around
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Now, whenever I get up and
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
By no special friend
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
To see him obviously framed
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
I run right home and I went to bed
He wagged his tail and shook his head
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Roving gambler, he was very bored
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Either from the mountains of Madrid
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Now you don't act so––so proud
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Now you don't seem so proud
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
You try so hard, but you don't understand
All the sweethearts you can hold
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
And your trouble is you know it too good
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Its iron claws attached
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
I will not go down under the ground
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
While some, on principles baptized
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
For what you sold that's not been received
If dogs run free, then what must be
Well, six white horses that you did promise
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
I rode with him in a taxi once
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The crashing waves roll over me
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
The man the authorities came to blame
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
See the primitive wallflower freeze
A bed that is never mine
"Oh, father, you will surely die
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The cause was there before we came
You into thinking you're the one
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
You said you'd never compromise
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Hunger pays a heavy price
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Full of hope and desire
On the rising curve
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
How was I to know you'd be the one
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Little did I realize
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
That she's the same one
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
What good am I then to others and me
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
And suddenly there appeared before me
Just pick anyone
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
I been wondering all about me
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Taking care of somebody nice
I do declare
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
So up she picked her babies three
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
I don't even notice she gone
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Though its shadow's metal badge
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
But I can't say I sympathize
Knows there's no success like failure
It's all new to me
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Should I leave them by your gate
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
You're not free to belong to me
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Limited in sex they dare
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
And I would send a message
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
As he rises to fame
And plenty time for good romance
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
You just pick anyone
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Better stay away from those
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
What's probably got you baffled more
Among the lovely people living free
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Should I put them by your gate
Most of the time I can't even be sure
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
When I'm all alone
And never sat once at the head of the table
You know, it's not even safe no more
I can survive and I can endure
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
With all memory and fate
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
So I remember every face
To give the special one you seek a chance
Remember me to one who lives there
From the start by the rule
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
I am homeless, come and take me
How many ears must one man have
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
And the Negro's name
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
At dawn my lover comes to me
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
When Reilly's daughter got a message
You say you're looking for someone
Feel to moan, but unlike before
They say don't come back no more
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
"It's only you that he does crave
There were times when I was so lonesome
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
But the dark does die
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Maybe someday you will look back and see
When the rain is blowing in your face
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Leaving men wholly, totally free
He'll see by his grave
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
What about that millionaire
If dogs run free, why not me
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Mona tried to tell me
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
While them that defend what they cannot see
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Remember me to the one who lives there
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
I'm sure you're the one to blame
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
It'll be with me unto the grave
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Where I could watch her waltz for free
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Up into some paradise
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
I'm ready for to fade
Just what you will say when you get home
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
It's getting dark, too dark to see
All I feel is heat and flame
From all the plans they do pursue
Well, it's all new to me
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
From the Golden Gate Bridge
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
But I can get another one
She knows there's no success like failure
If dogs run free, why not we
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
To show you something you seen before
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
What you're gonna say when you get home
Says it's closing time
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Waiting to find out what price
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
But it won't be over till they clear his name
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
So I look like a walking mountain range
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Why wait any longer for the one you love
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
She plunged him into well water where
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
So, I called up the operator of time
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
You smiling through the fence at me
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
You cut to the core
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
And I ain't complaining none
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Lies that life is black-and-white
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
We see this empty cage now corrode
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Looking at hands for the lines that were
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
But I feel nothing for their game
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
And you see why it's so unique to be
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
She been gone
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
When the roses fade
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Trust yourself
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
They're drinking up and walking
I know that you know that I know that you show something
The order is rapidly fading
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
She rode by night and came by morning
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
I can hear their hearts a-beating
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Where the time and the tempo drag
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
There's nothing in here moving
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And there's no telling who that it's naming
It's not a bad way to make a living
The order is a-rapidly fading
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
But then a whistle will be blowing
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
For your weary toes to be touching
Early in the morning, early in the morning
The battle outside raging
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Deceived me into thinking
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Beyond here lies nothing
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
You left me standing in the doorway crying
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
If I was with her too long
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
'Cause the battle outside raging
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I have fallen far beneath
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Then she told us how times were tough
And how I know I'll make it through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Girls' faces formed the forward path
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
You go north and you go south
Look out, the saints are coming through
You turn around to take a final peek
Well, there ain't no going back
The man in me will do nearly any task
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
I wish she'd unlock
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Shoot in the back
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Her voice once and talk
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Make everything from toy guns that spark
But they caught him and they brought him back
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
All and all can only fall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
A-how does it feel
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Soul to soul our shadows roll
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
He's sure got a lot of gall
How many seas must a white dove sail
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Muttering small talk at the wall
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Well, if I die on top of the hill
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Ring bar, hard to tell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
As the last fire-truck from hell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
How many seas must the white dove sail
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Then why don't she tell
How does it feel
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
To make all that should be killed to crawl
He's taught in his school
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
And if my love is real
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
A girl by the whirlpool
They ask me how I feel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Oh, how does it feel
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
I chased me a woman up the hill
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Ring bell, hard to tell
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
"For you cannot relive them
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
You better not chew gum
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Now, they asked me to read a poem
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
But I can hear another drum
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
And remain as I am
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Two eyes took the aim
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
And she wakes just like a woman
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Nothing we can call our own
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
"Not me," said the gambling man
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
That long, black train is pulling down
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Well, I'm hanging on
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Out of the shower comes a football man
To remember the times when I was your only man
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
But I swear I see my reflection
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Darkness at the break of noon
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
All their daughters put me down
And she aches just like a woman
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Have died in battle or in vain
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Well, you fake just like a woman
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
But the second mom was with the seventh son
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Yes, and someone must explain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
In the pigpen
My love, she's like some raven
I figure maybe we're even
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
She got such a sweet disposition
All lay down their bandanas and complain
That long, black train is pulling on down
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
But the post office has been stolen
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
The next morning she had awoken
I'll be waiting at the station
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
You don't need a weatherman
But all their daughters put me down
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
From heights that they could not gain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And there's no exit in any direction
To my knowledge there's just one man
How can the life of such a man
A-she takes just like a woman
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
In ceremonies of the horsemen
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
The ones that jump on the wagon
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Must meet the dawn
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I don't even care if I ever see her again
You need something to make it known
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
And the corner sign
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
And all their daughters put me down
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Somebody new to beat on
Trying to get a lead on
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Yet I swear I see my reflection
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
How many roads must a man walk down
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
She takes just like a woman
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
For the loser now might be later to win
But me, I expected it to happen
Advertising signs that con
Will not be understood as they're spoken
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
She said that all the railroad men
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Why did you trade heaven
But it's hard to think on
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And you ache a-just like a woman
You take just like a woman
Their religion of the little ten women
As you sit on the box you keep him in
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
For the loser now will be later to win
Please don't let on that you knew me when
He got that fortress on the mountain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Suicide remarks are torn
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Guns and clubs followed him down
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
All I really wanna do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Every place I wanna go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
There is a place you go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Silvio, I gotta go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
All I'd like you to do
There's nothing you can say or do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
What good am I while you softly weep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Man in the coon-skin cap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
How many times must a man look up
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
I walked down there and ended up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Aladdin and his lamp
My ship is in the harbor
All you boys better run for cover
I could feel a whole lot better
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
Who came here from Cuba's door
I don't have to go far
When you whispered in my ear
When only you are near
For all eternity I think I will remember
The lover who has just walked out your door
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
At any moment you could go under
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
You heard me saying a prayer for
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
The wind howls like a hammer
I close my eyes and I wonder
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
The face of God will appear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
She took him by his long, yellow hair
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Still I've always kind of missed her
Alone you stand with nobody near
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
But morning is clear
And I don't even think about her
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
For I am married to a house carpenter
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
I say, "Why you say that for
Still I say her love-words over
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
Never no more do I wonder
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
In one I was running and in another
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
So, don't fear if you hear
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Glide across the lonely years
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
You know that he has no intentions
Seven days
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Her window's wide open, African trees
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
The cowboy angel rides
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
True love can make a blade of grass
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And I try to harmonize with songs
You can fall down on your knees
You been hurt so many times
People on the platforms
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
I'm gonna let you pass
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
To memorizing politics
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
As friends and other strangers
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
In the dimestores and bus-stations
I'd gladly confess
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And your father, to your sister he explains
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
And the poor white remains
With a big bouquet of the roses
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Romantic facts of musketeers
Wants eleven dollar bills
And then complains
I let it slip gladly to my friends
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Thinking of a series of dreams
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
But, though the masters make the rules
People carry roses
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
On the back of the fish truck that loads
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
And so Patty calls the cops
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
"Not me," said the man whose fists
When your mother sends back all your invitations
The empty-handed painter from your streets
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
And the princess and the prince discuss
Girl by the whirlpool's
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
He's not selling any alibis
Statues made of matchsticks
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
They whisper in the wings
And, though the masters make the rules
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Six-time users
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Now, you must provide some answers
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
That it's you and no one else that owns
To sharpen the senses
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Well, the ragman draws circles
With a fantastic collection of stamps
What good am I if I say foolish things
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
You never turned around to see the frowns
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Six-time losers
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Good and bad, I define these terms
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
And inside it with the people made of molasses
You should be made to wear earphones
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And tells me of her dreams
Don't follow leaders
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
We living in times when men commit crimes
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And without further notice asks you how it feels
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
But still remains
I was thinking of a series of dreams
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
To the cutting of fences
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Don't wear sandals
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
I try to tell it like it is
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
At times I think there are no words
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Every new messenger bringing evil report
That might be all that you got
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
The slow one now will later be fast
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
You don't forget
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
One more night I will wait for the light
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Keep me set apart
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
How many years can some people exist
In the precious winds they rot
You used to laugh about
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Yet you know there is no answer fit
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
And, since my feet are now fast
But, if the arrow is straight
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
By the way, that's a cute hat
I think that it's best
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
I'm moving after midnight
I soon get some rest
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
In the stillness of the midnight
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
You're gonna get hit
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
You are there in the flickering light
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
To hold each other tight
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Keep it in your mind and not forget
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Well, early in the morning till late at night
You're hearing my heart beat
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
With your pockets well protected at last
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Someday, everything is gonna be different
One more night the moon is shining bright
She seems too far out
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
We can hold up a toast if we meet
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Everyone still talks about
Oh, everybody's got to eat
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
The slowest now will later be fast
Everything is always right
He really wasn't where it's at
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
They tell me to be discreet
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
It don't take too long to find out
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Wait for the morning light
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Without any doubt
Johnny's in the basement
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
You used to laugh–make fun about
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Well, I finally started thinking straight
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
So he never thinks straight
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Talking that the heat put
There's some people that
Plants in the bed, but
He built a fire on Main Street
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
And the first one now will later be last
And I, in my armor, turning about
I'm on the pavement
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
How many years can a mountain exist
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
They tell me revenge is sweet
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
I got into the driver's seat
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I can be just like you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
I'll remember you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To protect you and defend you
To be alone with you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
It's just crazy being here with you
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
It only goes to show
Don't it always a-go to show
The only one I know
Don't it always go to show
He been living there three years now
Ring them bells for the chosen few
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Yes, I'd sure like to know
I'd sure like to know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
But sooner or later one of us must know
Down every street there's a window
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Sooner or later one of us must know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
With only you in view
Well, I'd sure like to know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
How many times must the cannon balls fly
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
But I wish there was something you would do or say
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
For them that must obey authority
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
So they took him to the infirmary
We banged the drum slowly
Spouted out that liberty
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Well, I saw it advertised one day
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Or if you just want some company
Someone to get you flowers constantly
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
For them that think death––death's honesty
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
The same thing I would want today
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
To those condemned to act accordingly
For them that think death's honesty
She smiles, walks the other way
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Maggie says that many say
And it's up to you to say
And the only tune my guitar could play
So I run down most hurriedly
The Spanish-American War had its day
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
If I don't take the chance to try
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Went to the doctor the very next day
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
But you can never steal away
That I was just a puppet in a play
And that which you've given me today
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
My mind weaves a symphony
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
She starts to speak, but he walks away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
A cock is crowing far away
She knocked upon it anyway
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Is worth more than I could pay
No, you'll not now or no other day
He made the bells of freedom ring today
And the ladies treat me kindly
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
So, I'm walking down your highway
Don't you tell Henry
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
My ears hear a symphony
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
I send you all my money
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
From phony jealousy
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
But I can't deny
I did not do it harmfully
She puts it to me plain as day
And for His love they took His life away
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
How badly they were shocked –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
Havana–gee–
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
To know where you are –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Hava–na–
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Leave all the children home –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Disconnect these cables––
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Oh, my–
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
I got no idea what I want –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
I'm sure it was not three –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
With no other choice except but for to go –
With notions his canoe was laden –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Turn, turn, turn again –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Private reasons – great or small –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
I a-hope you can hear––
Havanagee–luh–
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Whispering your secret emotion –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
As suicide remarks are torn –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
You will not hear a laugh –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Indians camp along her border –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
I hope that you can hear––
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
It can't be this way everywhere –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
First degree and second degree –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
I long to hold you in the night –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Remember me to one who lives there –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Ha–va–
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Hang out the whole next day –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
