I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
It was the mailman!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Dignity never been photographed!
I'm in love with you!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Thank you!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
She's insane!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Start over!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Them Reds did it!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Woo-hoo!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
I got the freight train blues!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Take me down to California, baby!
Oh!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Looking for my lo and behold!
They was all over!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Yeah, man!
Woo!
Howdy, East Orange!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
You must think I'm crazy!
My God, they killed Him!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
I've got the freight train blues!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Good God!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Yes, come out your window!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Yippee!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Oh, no!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Play that guitar now!
I ain't different than anyone!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
So long, New York!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Alright!
I've got a million friends!
Lordy, Lord!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
I wanna be yours!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
He punched me out!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Hootenanny television!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Well!
Goodnight!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Oh, yeah!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Betty Ross!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
They got away!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Dance!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
How they ever flood my soul!
Alright, now!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
You can't blame us at all."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
And hung on a willow tree."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
Have it on Highway 61."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
You can't blame me at all."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
We want folksingers here."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
I'll bring back my lady."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And have it on Highway 61."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
And keep him good company."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
I love far better than thee."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"That way down Highway 61."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Will mourn for your return."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
But we were tangled up in blue."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
We'll both go home together."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
I would want again tomorrow."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
I'll apply them all to thee."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
I didn't see you around."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Get on your horse and ride away."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
"I've had too much of your company,"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
I can't find my knees."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
God said, "On Highway 61."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
It's all for the love of thee."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Come flowing down so free?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
And it's all for the love of thee."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
And pretend that you never have met."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
So write to her tenderly."
I'll see her soon, I know."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
You and I'll never know."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Tangled up in blue."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
They look as dark as night."
"Have you seen dignity?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Country'll grow."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Where you and I will unite."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
We'll both go off together."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
And punched my cigarette."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
But I know what you want."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Would kill a little bird like me."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
He said, "Tell me about it."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
You must know about my debutante."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
They look as white as snow."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
That you must always first forgive them."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
With a killer's pride, security,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Keep me where you are,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
All you can do is do what you must,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Well, get sick, get well,
And I know what you're thinking of,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
But the time ain't tall,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
I went back home, put on my tie,
So I got those worries blues,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Resent him to the bone,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Without your sweet love,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
And give him back the time he's done,
But I'm saved,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
God knows it's true,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
I can change, I swear,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
The day you quit me, baby,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Each one playing a horn,
I just say no thanks,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Friends with you,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
All that and more and then some,
I'm going down the river,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Made of silver or of golden,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Yet every distance is not near,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Baby, let me follow you down,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Four by four, no illusion for,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
You better duck down the alleyway,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Mercury, gravity,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
You're beautiful to me,
Thinking about the government,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Serve somebody,
They pass by so silently,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Try hard, get barred,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Like a rolling stone,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Never did feel this way before,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
And, if anybody asks me,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Get jailed, jump bail,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
With what your fate is going to be,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Spent my money on you, honey,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
And it's only that I'm asking,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
You better chew gum,
They say every man must fall,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
But I would not feel so all alone,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
And the whole world is on your case,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
You have given me eyes to see,
Without a love of my own,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Stay away from the train line,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
See you fly or watch you die,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
She said she would always stay,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
I been good while I been waiting,
You got to serve somebody,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
All the silver, all the gold,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
And gathering storms may arise,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
In love and with kindness,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
You have given everything to me,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
When I was in Missouri,
The carpet too is moving under you,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
You wanna drown love,
In the darkness of my night,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Going home,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Far away in the stormy night,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Don't wanna be a bum,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Six months on the chain gang,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Stone you when you are young and able,
If she ain't feeling well,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
We live in a political world,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
I love you, pretty baby,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I'm going out of my mind,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Every moon is so sanctified,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
My senses have been stripped,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Silhouetted by the sea,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
You can raise up your right hand,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I had no one for to go my bail,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
On the stone that remains,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
For her to arrive,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Don't let me change my heart,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
My limbs are shaking,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Better jump down a manhole,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Love that's pure no accident,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
I have no one to meet,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Going, going,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
The joint is jumping,
And the table's full and overflowed,
China doll, alcohol,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
By users, cheaters,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Read books, repeat quotations,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
I'll go see them come down my way,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
But something has changed,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
I went out last night to take a little round,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
All I really wanna do,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
"Not I," said the referee,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
My arms and legs were broken,
Love don't have any place,
Father of time and father of dreams,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
On this new morning, new morning,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
I want you so bad,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
To a solid rock,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
If ever I prove false to you,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Searching everywhere I know,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Of this I can't say very much,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Is looking for a new fool,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
When God and man will be reconciled,
They tell me every man must fall,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
I got the worried blues,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I never can go because, you know,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
You need something to open up a new door,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Bringing me all of your charms,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Father of cold and father of heat,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
You think you know the smile on her lips,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Roll, Willie, roll,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
In another I witnessed a crime,
The haunted, frightened trees,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
But it would not be new,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Drifting too far from shore,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Looking for a new fool,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
That five walls cannot hide him,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Father of night, father of day,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Alright, I'm so glad,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
The sky too is folding over you,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
They say every man needs protection,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Automobile coming into style,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
And to come each time you call,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
People going down to the ground,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
A foreign sound to your ear,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
But I know that he don't talk,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
He got that soft, silky skin,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
It was from her ship sailing,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
I like the cool way you look at me,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
In the instant that I preach,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Oh, singing just for you,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Who could they get to carry you,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Eh, singing just for you,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Or have done something wrong,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Each time we meet, love,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
And here I sit so patiently,
You could look at it and weep,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I can't cross the line, you know,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
I try my best to be just like I am,
And I'm back in the rain,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Going, going, gone,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Drag you down or drain you down,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
And come every time you call,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
They don't believe in mercy,
You broke a heart that loved you,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
In one the surface was frozen,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I went down where the vultures feed,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
And also by his feet,
And it's like I ain't here,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
In the foggy web of destiny,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
A man with a badge skips by,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
People talk over situations,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Father of loneliness and pain,
And the point is slick,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Says he's got a bad bill,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
I once held her in my arms,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Tell me that you love me only,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
For the politician's gain,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
I want my arms around you,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
With no direction home,
Watching the river flow,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
With the juice running down my leg,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
A worried man with a worried mind,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
But evidently she don't,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
We live and we die, we know not why,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Too noble to neglect,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Is used, it is plain,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Stone you and say good luck,
He been around the world and back again,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
While riding on a train going west,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
I long to see you in the morning light,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
And furnish me with tape,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Thank You, Lord,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
My existence led by confusion boats,
And you make love just like a woman,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Forever young, forever young,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Courage is a thing of the past,
The night would see me wide awake,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
You to me were true,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
You have explained every mystery,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
More people kept a-piling on,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
But ye shall be a-changed,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Gonna serve somebody,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
A complete unknown,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
To keep up his hate,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
He's the property of Jesus,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Don't let yourself fall,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
People carry roses,
Make you spin or do you in,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Tell her not to worry,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Don't wear sandals,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
And I'm so glad,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Get back, write Braille,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
May be an actor in a plot,
The man there said he loved my sound,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Nothing too very scientific,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Don't let me drift too far,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
They run a brick and tile company,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Who among them would try to impress you,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Come all without, come all within,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
They keep it all hid,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
It all seemed so well-timed,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
They say everything can be replaced,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Just like I did before,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Had no one to go my bail,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Front door shut, back door too,
Ten thousand men on the move,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
My woman's never sitting at home,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Since you've been gone,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
For the wise men and the fools,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Just as long as you stay with me,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
One more night the stars are in sight,
I'd be sad and blue,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
You have given me life to live,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
It's too bad he had to go,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I went down to scrub and rub,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Like you never did before,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
The man in the trench-coat,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
"Come along and take a trip,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
God knows there's a river,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
I'm leaving today,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Using every angle under the sun,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
And pay the price and not take your advice,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
You even make love just like a woman,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Where I will always be renewed,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
I got a wife and five little children,
Every brain is civilized,
Give you my money, honey,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
That can do what's never been done,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Far away and over the wall,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
But he's the property of Jesus,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
But, if I can save you any time,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
How many a year has passed and gone,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Tell me,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Puffing on a big cigar,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
I don't want to meet your kin,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Where mercy walks the plank,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
But you try with your whole soul,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
To stay closer than any friend,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Over your senses you have no control,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
It don't matter what you did,
Don't let her see,
Under the microscope,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
They say every man must need protection,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Went to the station down in the yard,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Want you,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
I got those worried blues,
I'll be on my way,
Like a complete unknown,
Don't follow leaders,
It's like I ain't here,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Need a woman all the time,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Light yourself a candle,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
My dear, sweet friend,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Said I'm pressing on,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
You were snow, you were rain,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Hmm, see what you can do,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
My love, she speaks softly,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Ye shall be changed,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
The only son of God Almighty,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Relationships of ownership,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Or select you or dissect you,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Joey, Joey,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Every head is so dignified,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I had so much left to do,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Yes, I'm so glad,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Heart of mine, be still,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
When the night comes falling,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And I'm in the shade,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Without a dream in my heart,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Give what I got until I got no more,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
God knows it's outta sight,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Go away from my window,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
The beat is pumping,
All the tired horses in the sun,
And pretend that we never have touched,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
The day would surely have to break,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Whether you are right or wrong,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
I can make it through,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Honey, just for you to climb,
We've killed each one,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Watered-down love,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
God knows that, when you see it,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Look away, you rolling river,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Like a dog on a chain,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Tears on the letter that I write,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
You had enough of hatred,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
In the turning of twilight,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
A man named Martin Luther King,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
But, if I will save you the time,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Seven days,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
I'd give you the sky high above,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
I've been in and out of happiness,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Well, I can't understand,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Ain't no going back,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
The night passed away so quickly,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Just to know that you are near,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Vanished from my hand,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Went back home to the yard,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Father of air and father of trees,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
That two healers cannot heal him,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Is it really any wonder,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Strike another match, go start anew,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
There's always someone who understands,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
But, to remain as friends,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
The wind howls like a hammer,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
The midnight rain follows the train,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
To be one your own,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
But now morning is clear,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Ye shall be a-changed,
I can finish this alone, honey,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Aim well, my little one,
God sees it all unfold,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Stand up straight and tall,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Dream about you, baby,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
How does it feel,
And your streets are getting empty,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
God knows when,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
To gather flowers constantly,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
And not going through any great extreme,
I got two white horses following me,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
A thousand miles from home,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
He won't do nothing to you,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And it ain't me, babe,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
In the end,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
While paupers change possessions,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And I got those worried blues,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Equality, liberty,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
We'll fly the night away,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
We'll go someplace unknown,
You can run down to the desert,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
You made it there somehow,
From their fates try to resign,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
God knows you ain't pretty,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I think we better talk this over,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
But you were gambling for support,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
The kingdoms of experience,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
To know how much I really care,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I had a dream about you, baby,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Father who build the mountain so high,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
But it ain't me, babe,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
And there's two white horses following me,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
The country music station plays soft,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Oh, Angelina,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
That you'd have liked me to,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
For she ain't the same,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
With his fist in a clinch,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
I would not feel so all alone,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
He is centuries old,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I fell down to my bended knees,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Silvio, I gotta go,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Private reasons, great or small,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
To be out on your own,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
A hand set the spark,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
We take great delight in our own company,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Just don't know what to do,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Looking 'bout the government,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
No, nothing was delivered,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
You've got to serve somebody,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
But, if you want me to,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
When I seen him lose control,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Icicles hanging down,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Ooh, watered-down love,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
And think they're fooling you,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
If I didn't have to guess,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
It's really something,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Someone to open each and every door,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Couldn't even see the floor,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
The light I never knowed,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
God knows how to make it flow,
Trust yourself,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
They say that every man must fall,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Grandpa died last week,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
By losers, cheaters,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
It always has hit me from below,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
So unknown,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
I just can't beg you anymore,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Too serious to fool,
In the hills of mystery,
Poor boy never say die,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
That the laws are with him,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
True love, they've been without it,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
And to come every time you call,
A dream about you, baby,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I got my mind made up,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
That can do what's a-never been done,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Nothing was delivered,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I thank the Lord,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Everything's a-hers or his,
For all intended purposes,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
She's the worst you could ever have,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
It's alright,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Want you so bad,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
When there is no more,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
God knows there's a heaven,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
As the present now will later be past,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Wintertime in New York town,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
One by one they follow the sun,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
She'll be coming forth,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
That her father was going to hang,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Strangers all give me the news,
You want watered-down love,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Wasn't making any great connection,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
As his youth now unfolds,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Get born, keep warm,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
But it ain't him to blame,
A true love of mine,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
First degree and second degree,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
True love of mine,
Well, I'm so glad,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Never weak, but always strong,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
The country doctor rambles,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
I've been around this whole country,
It's a price I have to pay,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I threw it all away,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Go melt back in the night,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Who will promise never to part,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Broken hands on broken plows,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
If'n you don't know by now,
You have given all there is to give,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Out to the windy beach,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
How he died nobody can say,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Over the hills and far away,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Had a dream about you, baby,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
You got something I want plenty of,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Baby, please stop crying,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Like some mystery,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Memory, ecstasy,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Keep a clean nose,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Just like a rolling stone,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Well, I been gambling so long,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
She got great big hind legs,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
To be alone with you,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Don't you tell Henry,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
In the shadows of moonlight,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
No direction home,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
New morning,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
I just don't see why I should even care,
If not for you,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
You stole her love from me one day,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
I try my best to be like I am,
Into my own parade,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
She said she would never forget,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Well, I'm pressing on,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
But I've been hanging on,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Searching high, searching low,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
And, though the line is cut,
By rivers of blindness,
In the little church a-this side of town,
As I travel down life's pathway,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
May be living in another country under another name,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Carved next to his name,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
I'd already gone the distance,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
He's not selling any alibis,
God knows there's a chance,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
If you'd see me this a-way,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Watch the plain-clothes,
When she lays upon the grass,
I get my sweet reward,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Better jump down the manhole,
And, if I can save you any time,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Someone to close his heart,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Well, I may just swear,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
I won't have my nature way,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
I'm never, never far from home,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
I'm so glad,
Waiting for the trains,
I can't understand,
I bless the day I found you,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
It hurts me, too,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Staying far behind without you,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
She never does me wrong,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Poor boy dressed in black,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
This world is ruled by violence,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Hazel, you called and I came,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Already the fiesta has begun,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Laying low,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
But I'm pressing on,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
You will be alright, girl,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Three angels up above the street,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
And, if I see the day,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Badge out, laid off,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
God don't call it treason,
He's young and on fire,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
She's opened up a happy home,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
A million faces at my feet,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
How he died nobody could say,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
In his anger and his shame,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
I run right home and I went to bed,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Maybe when we both get sober,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Mixing up the medicine,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
You got something better,
To shine in through,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
It's not aimed at anyone,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
And I'm just like that bird,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Don't steal, don't lift,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
If you'd see me this way,
Of ancient history,
Like as not, it's better so,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Where life and death are memorized,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
To protect his white skin,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
And she'll be coming forth,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Made before the foundation of the world,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Face full of black soot,
In the great unknown,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Madams light the candles,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Far past the frozen leaves,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Newspapermen eating candy,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
To be so useless and all,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I'd only have to stay,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
And I got the worried blues,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Look out, kid,
And forget my pride,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Bring the wife and family,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Cares not to come up any higher,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
It was you who came right through,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
They say every distance is not near,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Fare thee well but for a while,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Where the neon madmen climb,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
In the ruins of your balcony,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
People talk of situations,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Stripping away at it all,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
You and me, we had completeness,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
To strict party-platform ties,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Oh, see what you can do,
Precious memories, how they linger,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
I can see the turning of the key,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
But the bottles are done,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
May you stay forever young,
It's rising up above my head,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Dust on my face and my cape,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
That fellow who never blushes,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Don't matter what you did,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Get dressed, get blessed,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
King of the streets, child of clay,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Just then the order came to charge,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
The winter would hold no spring,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
To be––direction home,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
And the sooner you come up with them,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
God don't call it wrong,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
One by one until there were none,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Honey, I will meet you there,
And they––they look at me and frown,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Don't know what to do without it,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
They walk among the stately trees,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Don't ever try to change me,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Father of day, father of night,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Go down to the river, babe,
Not the end, not the end,
Heart of mine,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
I got a bird that whistles,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Oh, in somebody's room,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
I should have left this town this morning,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
And on the highway of regret,
She once was a true love of mine,
Far away from it all,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
They say every man need protection,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Loneliness, tenderness,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
The Communists was a-coming around,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
So, never leave me lonely,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Never needed to call you my whore,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Day you quit me, baby,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
That fired the gun,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Watch the river flow,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Father of black, father of white,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
You were striped, you were plain,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Don't let yourself stumble,
You can stick your head in the sand,
In a pine box for all eternity,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
I wish tonight were here,
Saved,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Without ideals or violence,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Look who's back in town,
Don't let her see that you need her,
I been riding the midnight train,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Up and down the block,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
When all will be well,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
You gotta look some other place,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
To be without a home,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
I swung on to my old guitar,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
They must bust in early May,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
But, it ain't me, babe,
You need something to open your eyes,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Living in the land of Nod,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
You follow, find yourself at war,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
God knows it's terrifying,
God knows you've got to weep,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
To your tambourine in time,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Loyalty, unity,
To have––be on your own,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
To be on your own,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
But you're doing it again,
Don't try No Doz,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
That they do not respect in any degree,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Well, I don't mind dying,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Don't tie no bows,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
The sky too is folding under you,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Hang around the ink-well,
Pressing on,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Try to be a success,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
I just keep pressing on,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
I need a shot of love,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
To find out if she's talked,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Don't let her know that you love her,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
She would have married me,
I can't be good, baby,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
For something that he never done,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
God knows it's fragile,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
I went into the city, into the town,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Precious father, loving mother,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
God knows it's a struggle,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
I want you,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
God knows everything,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
They––they show me to the door,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
"Not me," said his manager,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I been good,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
One by one they followed the sun,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
I know I can't win,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
If you can't quit your sinning,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
That one doctor cannot save him,
And, although that we're single and free,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Hold me, baby, be near,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
You'll be doing society a favor,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Ever since I been a child,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
It could even be like a myth,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
And point away from the past,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Seem like I been down this way before,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Simplify you, classify you,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Don't let her know,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
I shall be released,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
And you know I could never be your own,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
In the lonely night,
To hang and to lynch,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Speaking to some French girl,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
God knows it's a crime,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Got me a secret membership card,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
All them prophets good and gone,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
If you throw it all away,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
The air is getting hotter,
There she come, now, down my way,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
My woman needs it every day,
Eh, in somebody's room,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Rabbit running down across the road,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
It still ain't me, babe,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Advertising signs, they con,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
That must be what it's all about,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
At the close of the day,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Broken switches, broken gates,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Carry the New York Times,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
I just don't know what to do,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
I went into the red, went into the black,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
For his age he is wise,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
She'll surely turn to white,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
I got no place left to turn,
It always means so much,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
And you take just like a woman,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Don't let her hear,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Can't find what I need,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Circled by the circus sands,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Heart of mine, go back home,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
But he can't be blamed,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
But, deep inside my heart,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
The Second World War came to an end,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
God knows there's a purpose,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Corrina, Corrina,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Precious angel under the sun,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
I rambled out of New York town,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Well, well, well,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Trouble,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
I tried to reach you, honey,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
And played the fife lowly,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
So glad,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Thieving in the alley,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
And I answer them most mysteriously,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
You don't have to feed me,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Eh, see what you can do,
If you must cling to someone,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
This situation can only get rougher,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
You married young just like your ma,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Got my mind made up,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Why she did go,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Five by five they tried to survive,
I just can't do what I've done before,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
They lowered him down as a king,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
And she aches just like a woman,
Winter would have no spring,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
And may you stay forever young,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
You'll change your last name, too,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Oh, watered-down love,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Going,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
She leave by the other and roam,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
The one we can see and can feel,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
If anything is gonna sell,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Democracy don't rule the world --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
That's where you belong --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And shot it fulla holes.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
That Johanna's not here.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
While I'm in the hall.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
And the sails are spread.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
I'll remember you.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
While the law looks the other way.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
I threw it all away.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
I only saw what they let me see.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Oh, Angelina.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
All because his face was brown.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Everybody must get stoned.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
At my window with a broken wing.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
The sooner you can go.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
We were the wrong side.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
When she's better only time'll tell.
It always does when you're with me.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
You're drifting too far from shore.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
And I's left alone with three children.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Magic in a magical land.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
That set everybody free.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
He's got his mother's eyes.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
In this concrete world full of souls.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Your voice was all that I heard.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Someone to open each and every door.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Baby, two feet from the well.
To which a scoundrel clings.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Know not what the years may hold.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
There's no words that need to be said.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Wasn't any difference to me.
To anything I mighta tried.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
In the brightness of my day.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
Honey, come and see about me.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
In the summertime when you were with me.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
In the border-towns of despair.
When I'm alone with you.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
And that failure's no success at all.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
I don't know any more than this.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Rain would gather, too.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
I just can't beg you anymore.
Till your error you clearly learn.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Lost time is not found again.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
You always got more than enough rope.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
With an iron chain around his neck.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Trying to create a next world war.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Life don't mean a thing.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
For the times, they are a-changing.
The words that her lover had said.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Under the midnight moon.
The National Guard stands around his door.
They don't make nothing here no more.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
If you throw it all away.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Some place so high above the wall.
Hope that it don't sleet.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
And time is beginning to crawl.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
But the fighter still remains.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Bid farewell forever.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Mary wore three links of chain.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Far down the street we stray.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Carry for you deep down inside.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Duality, mortality.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
Precious memories flood my soul.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
She pretends like we never have met.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Need that woman straight and true.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Buildings going up to the sky.

Quicker than anyone I knew.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.

Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Take it on down to give me grow.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
Under the hedges.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
You know, I loved her just the same.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Hear me singing through these tears.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Tried to create a next world war.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
Blood on your saddle.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.

The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Broken voices on broken phones.
I will only let you down.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
I got trouble in my mind.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
I froze right to the bone.
I always thought that he was well.
You can't win with a losing hand.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.

Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.

One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Oh, got my mind made up.

With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.

Your temperature is too hot for taming.
What you'll say when you get home.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.

Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.

She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
Crying out that he was framed.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
For me to return to or chase.
What some people are gonna do for money.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
As the present now will later be past.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Come on, darling.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
And try to avoid the scandals.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Ever since we've been apart.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
To know which way the wind blows.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Everybody's having them dreams.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Oh, yes, they did.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Dollar a day's worth.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Tell me.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
The light I never knowed.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
That brave and devoted band.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
No kindred or relative nigh.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
You got a heart of stone.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Sound like it's on a final run.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
With my suitcase in my hand.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Soft as music, light as spring.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
68, but says she's 24.
I don't care what in the world you do.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
I never saw the man again.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
I just can't see through it anymore.
And I was brought up by my brother.
I said that.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Memories of what used to be.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
Behind a man's brain.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
I know the kinds of things you like.
All my connections too.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
In the pale moonlight.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Try to avoid the scandals.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
While evening slips away.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Hmm, tell me.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
With the glory that is to be.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
Of every man who put me here.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
Is what this thing here is for.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
And light on your right knee.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Down to New Orleans.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.

They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Honey, baby.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
I long to reach for you in the night.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
In fond memory appear.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.

That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.

I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Figuring a way to get back home.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
Hoping you'll come through too.
Saying wants company.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Throw my ticket out the window.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
And keep away from pranks.

Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.

Can't see over to the other side.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
The time and the place that we'd part.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And it is time for me to slide.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
My mind is breaking.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Valentines can't buy her.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Looking for a new friend.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
And get something quick to eat.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
You're a big girl all the way.
And you only got ten.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
I can't fire them anymore.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
But you break just like a little girl.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.

Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.

Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.

Until my dying-day.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.

All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
You're a big girl now.
But my heart just won't give in.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Now and forever let it be me.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.

All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.

We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
My baby took my heart from me.
I been worrying about you, baby.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Step lightly on the ground.
Look a-the other way.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
So the radio didn't work so well.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Come on, honey.
And discovered her invisible self.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
But with the country to where you're going.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
In the night the price was paid.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
That's the way I remember her best.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
Yes, and I'll go last.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Until I threw it all away.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Mine alone.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Going back where we come from.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Unless they're from another world.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Suffering like a fool.
Going through all these things twice.
And she had left him to die in there.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Go lightly on the ground.
You are on the bottom.
And say you'll always let it be me.
It only brings me sorrow.
Ever since I seen you there.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
To hold me in your arms.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
And I've never been too impressed.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
What's real and what is not.
At not getting their money's worth.
With gold and silver in her hand.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
See him at play makes me smile.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Gone as the season she's taken.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
I didn't feel so cold then.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Lay dead beside him there.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
It was you who understood.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
That old ship was a-going down.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
Or define you or confine you.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
From the little Minnesota town.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
Heart of mine.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Now you don't talk so loud.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Her fond face pale with woe.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Without this love that we call ours.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
That big, old boat started to sink.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Living down Sonora way.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
But you're back where you belong.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Bring that bottle over here.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Kisses she gave him three.
High society, notoriety.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Oh, convey herself away.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
I can't fight them anymore.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
"And light on my right knee.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
That number eleven was closing.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
And they gotta cut something.
Close your eyes, close the door.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
"Get well, get well," said she.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Without a love of my own.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
Slowly into autumn.
"Don't point your finger at me.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
And crime don't have a face.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
There's a guy I gotta see.
The same as my father before him.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
It hurts me, too.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
Come over here from over there, girl.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
Find out something only dead men know.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
To anything I might've tried.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Adiós, mi corazón.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
I just can't do what I done before.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
I think this time we should escape.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
Because everybody must get stoned.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
All because of the color of his skin.
Baby, baby...
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
On this new morning with you.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
I can't use it anymore.
Just you and me.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
I took some comfort there.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
She acts like we never met.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
And ye shall be changed.
For as long as love will last.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
Even before you came in the door.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
"Don't trill no news on me.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
Put me outta doors.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.

Throw my suitcase out there too.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
But I know that I can't move.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.

Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.

Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.

No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
They found him dead in the street one day.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Trust yourself.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Now they say it's the land of money.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Is tearing up your mind.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
There was nobody around.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
I had something to protect.
That linger in the fireball heat.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
And all I see are dark eyes.
You're the only love I've ever known.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
And I need you, ah.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
Orders from the D.A.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
It's just the same as talking to you.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
I see better days and I do better things.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Fighting every inch of the way.
I got a bird that sings.
You give something up for everything you gain.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Baby, baby.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Like you never done before.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
I'll hold it down for you.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
A man named Martin Luther King...
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
Where I was born and partly raised.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
You want a watered-down love.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
By the jealousy of others around her.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
You know the song in my heart.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
The place that I started from.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Havanageeluh.
I'm not the one you need.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
I don't even know why we come.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
My face you'll never see no more.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
And relive my dreams.
Mama, you are on my mind.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
From my toes up to my ears.
Hope I don't blow it.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
As if a wedding vow.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
And your highway's getting filled.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Please let me ride you home.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
I'm younger than that now.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
I once held her in my arms.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
And I'll rock you too.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
You're on the bottom.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
I'm falling in love with you.
Neighborhood bully.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
I stood wondering which way to go.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
But I ain't neither one.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
My baby told me I would have to go.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
So, darling, you better come through.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Everything is gonna be alright.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
Even the softest touch.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
His epitaph plain:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Serve somebody:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
But there's one promise, darling:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Till I come into New York town:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Some speak of the future;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Everybody that was hanging out;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
All lies and jest;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Make promises by the hour;
I find complete love;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
So many things that we never will undo;
Had to be held down by big police;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Crumble into one another;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<p>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
So I can know if I'm really real?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
By golly, what more can I say?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Am I ready?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
How does it feel?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
What good am I?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
What would life be?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Gal, where you been so long?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Baby, can't you tell?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Where did you lose your wings?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Before it's washed to the sea?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Where did you hide your halo?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Can I come home with you?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
For all these earthly things?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Across the swooping plain?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Have they missed you?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
How many compared to yesterday?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Before you call him a man?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
And how does it feel?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Too many people have died?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
That too many people have died?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Are you ready?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Does anyone even try?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
What can I give to You?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
How could they ever mistake you?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Across the swamp of time?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
What do you think about that, my friend?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Can you get back in?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Does he change the course of rivers?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
When he's standing in front of you?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Poor boy, where you been?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
When did you leave heaven?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
And one deserving of affection?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Why and what's the reason for?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
How can I live for You?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Of everything you see?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Before it is washed to the sea?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Just like a rolling stone?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
What's wrong with you this time?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Has anybody seen my love?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How's everything in heaven?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Before he can see the sky?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
To love and follow His direction?
Before he can hear people cry?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
What else can a poor boy do?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
How many more without any reward?
Before they're forever banned?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
How could they let you go?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Like a rolling stone?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Who you thought you were talking to?
How much poison did they inhale?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Why would I want to take your life?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
How many more can they afford?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Must everybody bow?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
But am I still dreaming yet?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
What can I do for You?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
You have to pay to get outta
It was put together down in Argentina
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
The changes I was going through can't even be used
You used to be so amused
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
I thought that it was well-understood
Silvio, silver and gold
I want you, baby, just to understand
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Either from the mountains of Madrid
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Things would be different the next time we wed
Many times I've often prayed
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
But now something has changed
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
But something has changed
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
You try so hard, but you don't understand
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
It's something you did
Nothing was delivered
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
I run right home and I went to bed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
So I'll make my stand
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
I'll always thank the Lord
And into the path you are hurled
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
How many times can a man turn his head
I live in another world
Maybe someday you will understand
Now you don't seem so proud
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
I've been walking around
For what you sold that's not been received
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
But she ain't gonna find the road
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Now, a very great man once said
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Somebody seen him hanging around
Now, whenever I get up and
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Standing on the water, casting your bread
I will not go down under the ground
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
And those whom doom and death had spared
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
"Equality". I spoke the word
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
He was a clean-cut kid
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
To see him obviously framed
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
As I stand upon the sand
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
We live in a political world
All the sweethearts you can hold
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
There ain't nothing in this world
And things would be different the next time we wed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Roving gambler, he was very bored
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
You used––be so proud
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
While some, on principles baptized
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
She let go of my hand
By no special friend
But all that suffering was not to be compared
And then you told me later as I apologized
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Its iron claws attached
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Just what you had in mind
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
And your trouble is you know it too good
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
They took a clean-cut kid
Now you don't act so––so proud
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
You just pick anyone
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
You're not free to belong to me
We see this empty cage now corrode
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
If dogs run free, why not me
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
The crashing waves roll over me
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I am homeless, come and take me
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Where I could watch her waltz for free
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Full of hope and desire
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
What good am I then to others and me
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
So I look like a walking mountain range
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Taking care of somebody nice
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Knows there's no success like failure
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Con you into thinking that you're the one
I don't even notice she gone
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
See the primitive wallflower freeze
There were times when I was so lonesome
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
She plunged him into well water where
To show you something you seen before
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
"It's only you that he does crave
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Well, it's all new to me
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Though its shadow's metal badge
When Reilly's daughter got a message
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
And I ain't complaining none
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And never sat once at the head of the table
Says it's closing time
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
But the dark does die
You smiling through the fence at me
They say don't come back no more
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
When the roses fade
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
You cut to the core
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
It's getting dark, too dark to see
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Everybody's wearing a disguise
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Up into some paradise
Well, six white horses that you did promise
You say you're looking for someone
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Waiting to find out what price
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
That she's the same one
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
So, I called up the operator of time
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
From the start by the rule
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Lies that life is black-and-white
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
To give the special one you seek a chance
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
But it won't be over till they clear his name
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
You said you'd never compromise
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
While them that defend what they cannot see
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
A bed that is never mine
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
And suddenly there appeared before me
Remember me to the one who lives there
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Looking at hands for the lines that were
What about that millionaire
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
And I would send a message
On the rising curve
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
As he rises to fame
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
When I'm all alone
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I been wondering all about me
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
He'll see by his grave
Just what you will say when you get home
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
I'm ready for to fade
All I feel is heat and flame
Maybe someday you will look back and see
It's all new to me
And you see why it's so unique to be
I can survive and I can endure
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
What you're gonna say when you get home
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Should I put them by your gate
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
So I remember every face
Should I leave them by your gate
How many ears must one man have
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
So up she picked her babies three
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Little did I realize
With all memory and fate
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
From all the plans they do pursue
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
You into thinking you're the one
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
You could almost think that you're seeing double
When the rain is blowing in your face
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Hunger pays a heavy price
"That I might be gone a long, old time
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Remember me to one who lives there
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Why wait any longer for the one you love
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
It'll be with me unto the grave
She knows there's no success like failure
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
She been gone
But I feel nothing for their game
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Among the lovely people living free
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Leaving men wholly, totally free
If dogs run free, then what must be
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Mona tried to tell me
The cause was there before we came
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
And her silver-studded phantom cause
How was I to know you'd be the one
"Oh, father, you will surely die
At dawn my lover comes to me
Better stay away from those
You know, it's not even safe no more
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
I do declare
But I can't say I sympathize
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And plenty time for good romance
I rode with him in a taxi once
If dogs run free, why not we
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Limited in sex they dare
And the Negro's name
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
The man the authorities came to blame
What's probably got you baffled more
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Just pick anyone
But I can get another one
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Everybody sees hisself
Trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
'Cause the battle outside raging
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Well, I set my monkey on the log
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Where the time and the tempo drag
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
It's not a bad way to make a living
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
But then a whistle will be blowing
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
There's nothing in here moving
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
The order is a-rapidly fading
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
For your weary toes to be touching
The battle outside raging
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
She rode by night and came by morning
And the cards are no good that you're holding
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
If I was with her too long
I know that you know that I know that you show something
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Deceived me into thinking
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Beyond here lies nothing
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
They're drinking up and walking
The order is rapidly fading
What am I saying? What am I knowing
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Then she told us how times were tough
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
You go north and you go south
And how I know I'll make it through
I have fallen far beneath
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Shoot in the back
You turn around to take a final peek
Her voice once and talk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Well, there ain't no going back
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
The man in me will do nearly any task
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
But they caught him and they brought him back
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
I wish she'd unlock
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
He's taught in his school
Then why don't she tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
He's sure got a lot of gall
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
As the last fire-truck from hell
How does it feel
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Ring bar, hard to tell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
I chased me a woman up the hill
How many seas must a white dove sail
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Oh, how does it feel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
To make all that should be killed to crawl
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
A girl by the whirlpool
And if my love is real
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
They ask me how I feel
Muttering small talk at the wall
All and all can only fall
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
How many seas must the white dove sail
Well, if I die on top of the hill
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Ring bell, hard to tell
A-how does it feel
But I can hear another drum
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
You better not chew gum
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
"For you cannot relive them
So, one morning when the sun was warm
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
And remain as I am
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Two eyes took the aim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
My love, she's like some raven
Out of the shower comes a football man
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Well, you fake just like a woman
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
To remember the times when I was your only man
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Must meet the dawn
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
You need something to make it known
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Yes, and someone must explain
How can the life of such a man
"Not me," said the gambling man
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
From heights that they could not gain
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
That long, black train is pulling down
And there's no exit in any direction
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Why did you trade heaven
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
As they rode him in custody down to the station
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Well, I'm hanging on
But all their daughters put me down
And she wakes just like a woman
I figure maybe we're even
That long, black train is pulling on down
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Yet I swear I see my reflection
In the pigpen
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
A-she takes just like a woman
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
The ones that jump on the wagon
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
The next morning she had awoken
But it's hard to think on
And all their daughters put me down
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Trying to get a lead on
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
I don't even care if I ever see her again
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
She said that all the railroad men
She takes just like a woman
I'll be waiting at the station
You take just like a woman
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
And the corner sign
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
How many roads must a man walk down
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
He got that fortress on the mountain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
But the second mom was with the seventh son
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Darkness at the break of noon
To my knowledge there's just one man
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Will not be understood as they're spoken
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Suicide remarks are torn
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
All their daughters put me down
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Somebody new to beat on
And the smell of their roses does not remain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Their religion of the little ten women
But me, I expected it to happen
Nothing we can call our own
For the loser now might be later to win
But the post office has been stolen
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
There was little to say, there was no conversation
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And you ache a-just like a woman
Guns and clubs followed him down
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
For the loser now will be later to win
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Advertising signs that con
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Have died in battle or in vain
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
You don't need a weatherman
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
She got such a sweet disposition
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
But I swear I see my reflection
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And she aches just like a woman
Silvio, I gotta go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Every place I wanna go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
There's nothing you can say or do
All I really wanna do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
There is a place you go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
All I'd like you to do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
It's very nice to stay a week or two
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Aladdin and his lamp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Man in the coon-skin cap
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What good am I while you softly weep
I walked down there and ended up
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
The man in the coon-skin cap
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
How many times must a man look up
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
When you whispered in my ear
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
She took him by his long, yellow hair
And I don't even think about her
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
When only you are near
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
In one I was running and in another
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
I could feel a whole lot better
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
I say, "Why you say that for
You heard me saying a prayer for
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
The face of God will appear
All you boys better run for cover
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
Still I've always kind of missed her
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
For all eternity I think I will remember
The wind howls like a hammer
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Still I say her love-words over
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
So, don't fear if you hear
I don't have to go far
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
But morning is clear
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
My ship is in the harbor
Who came here from Cuba's door
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
I close my eyes and I wonder
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
For I am married to a house carpenter
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Never no more do I wonder
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Alone you stand with nobody near
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
At any moment you could go under
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
The lover who has just walked out your door
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
"Not me," said the man whose fists
To memorizing politics
I was thinking of a series of dreams
People on the platforms
You should be made to wear earphones
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
You never turned around to see the frowns
Romantic facts of musketeers
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Well, the ragman draws circles
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
And without further notice asks you how it feels
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Thinking of a series of dreams
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
That it's you and no one else that owns
And then complains
But still remains
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Good and bad, I define these terms
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
And the princess and the prince discuss
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And so Patty calls the cops
You can fall down on your knees
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
What good am I if I say foolish things
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
But, though the masters make the rules
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
You know that he has no intentions
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
You been hurt so many times
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Statues made of matchsticks
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Girl by the whirlpool's
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
On the back of the fish truck that loads
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Seven days
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Now, you must provide some answers
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
As friends and other strangers
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And your father, to your sister he explains
To the cutting of fences
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
True love can make a blade of grass
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Six-time losers
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
And tells me of her dreams
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
I try to tell it like it is
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Don't follow leaders
I'd gladly confess
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
To sharpen the senses
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
The empty-handed painter from your streets
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
With a fantastic collection of stamps
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
With a big bouquet of the roses
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
People carry roses
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the poor white remains
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
We living in times when men commit crimes
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
They whisper in the wings
And, though the masters make the rules
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
And inside it with the people made of molasses
At times I think there are no words
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Glide across the lonely years
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And I try to harmonize with songs
In the dimestores and bus-stations
The cowboy angel rides
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
He's not selling any alibis
Six-time users
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Don't wear sandals
Her window's wide open, African trees
Wants eleven dollar bills
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
I'm gonna let you pass
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I let it slip gladly to my friends
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
He really wasn't where it's at
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Ain't it hard when you discover that
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
She seems too far out
I think that it's best
And, since my feet are now fast
It don't take too long to find out
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
The slow one now will later be fast
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
They tell me revenge is sweet
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
I got into the driver's seat
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
You used to laugh about
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Keep it in your mind and not forget
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
By the way, that's a cute hat
One more night I will wait for the light
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Johnny's in the basement
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
With your pockets well protected at last
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
How many years can some people exist
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Like a corkscrew to my heart
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Plants in the bed, but
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Oh, everybody's got to eat
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
And the first one now will later be last
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
So he never thinks straight
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
You used to laugh–make fun about
To keep it in your mind and not forget
You're hearing my heart beat
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
One more night the moon is shining bright
Someday, everything is gonna be different
But, if the arrow is straight
I soon get some rest
I'm moving after midnight
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Wait for the morning light
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
How many years can a mountain exist
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Without any doubt
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
To hold each other tight
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Everything is always right
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Everyone still talks about
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
He built a fire on Main Street
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Yet you know there is no answer fit
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
In the precious winds they rot
Every new messenger bringing evil report
That might be all that you got
The slowest now will later be fast
You are there in the flickering light
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
There's some people that
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
And I, in my armor, turning about
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
In the stillness of the midnight
Talking that the heat put
You don't forget
You're gonna get hit
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
I'm on the pavement
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Keep me set apart
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
They tell me to be discreet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I'll remember you
It's just crazy being here with you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To be alone with you
I can be just like you
To protect you and defend you
Ring them bells for the chosen few
The only one I know
Well, I'd sure like to know
With only you in view
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Don't it always go to show
But sooner or later one of us must know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always a-go to show
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
I'd sure like to know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Down every street there's a window
He been living there three years now
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
It only goes to show
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Sooner or later one of us must know
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
And the only tune my guitar could play
Well, I'm walking down the highway
And for His love they took His life away
To those condemned to act accordingly
But I can't deny
I did not do it harmfully
A cock is crowing far away
Maggie says that many say
And that which you've given me today
My mind weaves a symphony
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
But I wish there was something you would do or say
So I run down most hurriedly
My ears hear a symphony
Well, I saw it advertised one day
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Someone to get you flowers constantly
No, you'll not now or no other day
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
So, I'm walking down your highway
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
How many times must the cannon balls fly
He made the bells of freedom ring today
And the ladies treat me kindly
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
The same thing I would want today
If I don't take the chance to try
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
That I was just a puppet in a play
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Is worth more than I could pay
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
From phony jealousy
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
For them that think death's honesty
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
So they took him to the infirmary
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
That I done it the way
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
And it's up to you to say
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
We banged the drum slowly
I send you all my money
She knocked upon it anyway
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Went to the doctor the very next day
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
For them that think death––death's honesty
Spouted out that liberty
And I'm leaving every day to run away
But you can never steal away
Don't you tell Henry
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Or if you just want some company
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
The Spanish-American War had its day
She puts it to me plain as day
For them that must obey authority
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
She smiles, walks the other way
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Though I'd never say
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
I hope that you can hear––
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
I long to hold you in the night –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Without a reply I left by the moon –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Hava–na–
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
It can't be this way everywhere –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Whispering your secret emotion –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
That can win what's a-never been won –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
I'm sure it was not three –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Disconnect these cables––
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Oh, my–
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Ha–va–
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
To know where you are –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Havana–gee–
With no other choice except but for to go –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
I got no idea what I want –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
I a-hope you can hear––
Havanagee–luh–
How badly they were shocked –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Haven't seen her since that night –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Leave all the children home –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Private reasons – great or small –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
With notions his canoe was laden –
First degree and second degree –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Turn, turn, turn again –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
One of these days – and it won't be long –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Hang out the whole next day –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Indians camp along her border –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
You will not hear a laugh –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
