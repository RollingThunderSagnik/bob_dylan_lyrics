This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!

He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!

She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
My God, they killed Him!
Start over!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
They got away!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
I ain't different than anyone!
I'm in love with you!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
That you must always first forgive them."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
I would want again tomorrow."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
They look as white as snow."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
And keep him good company."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
He said, "Tell me about it."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
You can't blame us at all."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
You and I'll never know."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
So write to her tenderly."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I love far better than thee."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You must know about my debutante."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Tangled up in blue."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Will mourn for your return."
For that reason I will have to stay."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
I didn't see you around."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
And pretend that you never have met."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
And have it on Highway 61."
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
But I know what you want."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Get on your horse and ride away."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
It's all for the love of thee."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
I'll bring back my lady."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
I can't find my knees."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
And hung on a willow tree."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Where you and I will unite."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
I'll see her soon, I know."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
And punched my cigarette."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
You can't blame me at all."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
They look as dark as night."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"That way down Highway 61."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Has kindly assisted me home."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
I'll apply them all to thee."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
We want folksingers here."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
And it's all for the love of thee."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Country'll grow."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
God said, "On Highway 61."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
"I've had too much of your company,"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
We'll both go off together."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Have it on Highway 61."
Come flowing down so free?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
We'll both go home together."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"Have you seen dignity?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
Go melt back in the night,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Someone to close his heart,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Broken lines, broken strings,
God knows you've got to weep,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
You have given me life to live,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
It was from her ship sailing,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
One by one they follow the sun,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
I just don't know what to do,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
First degree and second degree,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Poor boy dressed in black,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
To strict party-platform ties,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Precious father, loving mother,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Father of night, father of day,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
I went into the city, into the town,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Advertising signs, they con,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
To be so useless and all,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Up and down the block,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
I been good,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Speaking to some French girl,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
I'm so glad,
Don't you tell Henry,
Where I will always be renewed,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
I just keep pressing on,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Is used, it is plain,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Relationships of ownership,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
The one we can see and can feel,
When the night comes falling,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
It's like I ain't here,
And I got those worried blues,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
My love, she speaks softly,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
In the hills of mystery,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
To hang and to lynch,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
New morning,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Laying low,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
People carry roses,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
Want you,
You to me were true,
I could have left this town by noon,
Badge out, laid off,
Watching the river flow,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
And I got the worried blues,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
She leave by the other and roam,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Like a dog on a chain,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
God knows there's a river,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
A man with a badge skips by,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Oh, Angelina,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
It's a price I have to pay,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
I couldn't see where we were going,
You've got to serve somebody,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
A million faces at my feet,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Had no one to go my bail,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
With the juice running down my leg,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
But I'm saved,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Why she did go,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
You have given me eyes to see,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
My dear, sweet friend,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Light yourself a candle,
Just then the order came to charge,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Stay away from the train line,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Six months on the chain gang,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
They keep it all hid,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Made before the foundation of the world,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
And there's two white horses following me,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Every head is so dignified,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Looking 'bout the government,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Someone to open each and every door,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Don't follow leaders,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Each time we meet, love,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
I know I can't win,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
How many a year has passed and gone,
I shall be released,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
And the point is slick,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
The only son of God Almighty,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Five by five they tried to survive,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Broken switches, broken gates,
A hand set the spark,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Don't let her know that you love her,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
She's opened up a happy home,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
I try my best to be just like I am,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Beyond here lies nothing,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
And ye shall be a-changed,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Gonna serve somebody,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
And not going through any great extreme,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
And rivers that ran through every day,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Under the microscope,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Want you so bad,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
For she ain't the same,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Serve somebody,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Where life and death are memorized,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
I try my best to be like I am,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Read books, repeat quotations,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Don't know what to do without it,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
In the turning of twilight,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
All you can do is do what you must,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
And forget my pride,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Wintertime in New York town,
King of the streets, child of clay,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Staying far behind without you,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
And point away from the past,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
God knows when,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Just like a rolling stone,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
The sky too is folding over you,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
To find out if she's talked,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
I should have left this town this morning,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Is it really any wonder,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
While paupers change possessions,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Memory, ecstasy,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Give you my money, honey,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
It's really something,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
China doll, alcohol,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
But something has changed,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
It's too bad he had to go,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
He's the property of Jesus,
To a solid rock,
The light I never knowed,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Searching everywhere I know,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
They took a clean-cut kid,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
And I'm back in the rain,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
With a killer's pride, security,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
True love, they've been without it,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
Says he's got a bad bill,
You find God in the church of your choice,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Better jump down a manhole,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
I went down where the vultures feed,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
A worried man with a worried mind,
You can hear them tires squeal,
And, though the line is cut,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Well, I gave you all my money,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
To keep up his hate,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
I had no one for to go my bail,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
May be living in another country under another name,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
And give him back the time he's done,
And, if I can save you any time,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
And here I sit so patiently,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
And you make love just like a woman,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
But I would not feel so all alone,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Madams light the candles,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
My limbs are shaking,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
Stripping away at it all,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I don't wanna fake you out,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
You need something to open up a new door,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
They pass by so silently,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Can't find what I need,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
The man in the trench-coat,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Going home,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
And she aches just like a woman,
And, on their promises of paradise,
It's alright,
Father of black, father of white,
Precious angel under the sun,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Friends with you,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Forever young, forever young,
I threw it all away,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
Thinking about the government,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Stone you when you are young and able,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Keep me where you are,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
And it's only that I'm asking,
You made it there somehow,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
See her in that very tight skirt,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
But you try with your whole soul,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
When she lays upon the grass,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
My woman needs it every day,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Look out, kid,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
The kingdoms of experience,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
You have given all there is to give,
Oh, singing just for you,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
They say everything can be replaced,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Got me a secret membership card,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
How he died nobody could say,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
I want you so bad,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Made of silver or of golden,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I can't understand,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
You got something I want plenty of,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Nothing too very scientific,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Loneliness, tenderness,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
The winter would hold no spring,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Wasn't making any great connection,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
I have no one to meet,
One by one until there were none,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Automobile coming into style,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
But I know that he don't talk,
That must be what it's all about,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
You gotta look some other place,
Look who's back in town,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
She said she would always stay,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Till both of us fell by the way,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
And gathering storms may arise,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
I thank the Lord,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Without your sweet love,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Every nerve is analyzed,
We'll go someplace unknown,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
The day would surely have to break,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Far away from it all,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Don't let her know,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
And I know what you're thinking of,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
If you must cling to someone,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
You can raise up your right hand,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
I went out last night to take a little round,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
I get my sweet reward,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
If she ain't feeling well,
Father who build the mountain so high,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
You don't have to feed me,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Don't mind the driving rain,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
You can run down to the desert,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
That long, black train is pulling down,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
I'm going out of my mind,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
It was a girl I learned it from,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
That can do what's a-never been done,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
They don't believe in mercy,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
In the foggy web of destiny,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
I'll go see them come down my way,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Simplify you, classify you,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
"Not I," said the referee,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Honey, just for you to climb,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
That can do what's never been done,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Father of minutes, father of days,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
She would have married me,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Go down to the river, babe,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
They say every man needs protection,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Going, going,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Yet every distance is not near,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
You even make love just like a woman,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Don't let her see,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Resent him to the bone,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Don't let me change my heart,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
He's young and on fire,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
The midnight rain follows the train,
May be an actor in a plot,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Drag you down or drain you down,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Rabbit running down across the road,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
I've been saved - well, alright,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I got those worried blues,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Just like I did before,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
The train leaves at half past ten,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
I wish I a-was a magician,
God knows everything,
I'd only have to stay,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
For the politician's gain,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
That fired the gun,
As his youth now unfolds,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
She once was a true love of mine,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
That fellow who never blushes,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Don't ever try to change me,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
My senses have been stripped,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Come on, come on, stick together,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
For something that he never done,
God knows there's a chance,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
And she'll be coming forth,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Icicles hanging down,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
For the wise men and the fools,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
But it would not be new,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
With his fist in a clinch,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Don't matter what you did,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Oh, watered-down love,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Well, I don't mind dying,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
I just can't do what I've done before,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
So many roads, so much at stake,
But, to remain as friends,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
A dream about you, baby,
Joey, Joey,
Carry the New York Times,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
Private reasons, great or small,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
But, deep inside my heart,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Looking for a new fool,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
People talk of situations,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
We never much thought we could get very old,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
By losers, cheaters,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
So unknown,
And the whole world is on your case,
He been around the world and back again,
The night passed away so quickly,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Well, well, well,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Judge and jury took their stand,
She'll surely turn to white,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
In the lonely night,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
A question in your nerves is lit,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Not the end, not the end,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
But I've been hanging on,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Went to the station down in the yard,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Day you quit me, baby,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Each one playing a horn,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Or have done something wrong,
But you were gambling for support,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
That foreign sound in your ear,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
True love of mine,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Of ancient history,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
But he's the property of Jesus,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Trouble,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Going,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
So, never leave me lonely,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
But he can't be blamed,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
When I was in Missouri,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
The haunted, frightened trees,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
I rambled out of New York town,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Well, I can't understand,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
One by one they followed the sun,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
You have explained every mystery,
I can finish this alone, honey,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I can't cross the line, you know,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Don't steal, don't lift,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
This situation can only get rougher,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Just to know that you are near,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
And it's like I ain't here,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Never weak, but always strong,
To have--be on your own,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Living in the land of Nod,
And I'm just like that bird,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Who could they get to carry you,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
You stole her love from me one day,
But, if you want me to,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
A thousand miles from home,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
If not for you,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
The carpet too is moving under you,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Without a dream in my heart,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Hang around the ink-well,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
If anything is gonna sell,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
It was you who came right through,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Thank You, Lord,
As the present now will later be past,
And think they're fooling you,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Grandpa died last week,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
I would not feel so all alone,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
My love, she speaks like silence,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Without a love of my own,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Father of cold and father of heat,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
And also by his feet,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Mercury, gravity,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Pressing on,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
And, if I see the day,
Yesterday's just a memory,
I love you, pretty baby,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
We've killed each one,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
All that's gold doesn't shine,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
And furnish me with tape,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I can change, I swear,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
But now morning is clear,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Just remember that death is not the end,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
And, when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Well, the job that you used to have,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
To gather flowers constantly,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
God knows that, when you see it,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
Circled by the circus sands,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Cares not to come up any higher,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
The beat is pumping,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
She never does me wrong,
Carved next to his name,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Love that's pure no accident,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
I fell down to my bended knees,
More people kept a-piling on,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Ye shall be a-changed,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
I got a wife and five little children,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Bring the wife and family,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
God sees it all unfold,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
But the bottles are done,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Well, I'm so glad,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
And the table's full and overflowed,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
I need a shot of love,
If you can't quit your sinning,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
You and me, we had completeness,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
There's always someone who understands,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Too noble to neglect,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
That you'd have liked me to,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Front door shut, back door too,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
They tell me every man must fall,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
People talk over situations,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
So glad,
Over the hills and far away,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Father of air and father of trees,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
They walk among the stately trees,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Heart of mine, be still,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
If'n you don't know by now,
On the stone that remains,
Broken hands on broken plows,
In the end,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
The wind blowing the snow around,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
God knows it's terrifying,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
God knows it's a struggle,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
She got great big hind legs,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
I think we better talk this over,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
They--they show me to the door,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I got the worried blues,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
But I'm pressing on,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Over your senses you have no control,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
There she come, now, down my way,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Vanished from my hand,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Come all without, come all within,
To be--direction home,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Dream about you, baby,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Don't tie no bows,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
All that and more and then some,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
God don't call it treason,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
The air is getting hotter,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
And your streets are getting empty,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
But it ain't me, babe,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Courage is a thing of the past,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Searching high, searching low,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Strike another match, go start anew,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
To shine in through,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
See you fly or watch you die,
Far away in the stormy night,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
The joint is jumping,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Don't let her see where you're going,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
In another I witnessed a crime,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
People going down to the ground,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
To your tambourine in time,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Read books and repeat quotations,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
It all seemed so well-timed,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Since you've been gone,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Never did feel this way before,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
You came down on me like white thunder,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
You got to serve somebody,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Poor boy never say die,
And it ain't me, babe,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
That the laws are with him,
Yes, I want you so bad,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Ever since I been a child,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
God knows it's outta sight,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
You want watered-down love,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
So I got those worries blues,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Too serious to fool,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Don't let me drift too far,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
You were snow, you were rain,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
The country music station plays soft,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
And on the highway of regret,
I wish tonight were here,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
They say every man must fall,
Going, going, gone,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
With no direction home,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
You will be alright, girl,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
God don't call it wrong,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
You better chew gum,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
To be on your own,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
I won't have my nature way,
With what your fate is going to be,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Every brain is civilized,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
"Come along and take a trip,
Aim well, my little one,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
He's not selling any alibis,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Need a woman all the time,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
She's the worst you could ever have,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Went back home to the yard,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Eh, singing just for you,
Like some mystery,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Ooh, watered-down love,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
You were striped, you were plain,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
From their fates try to resign,
I want you,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
And may you stay forever young,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I'm going back to Colorado,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
I got a bird that whistles,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
To be one your own,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Saved,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
They say every man need protection,
You'll be doing society a favor,
I want my arms around you,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Love don't have any place,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
And, if anybody asks me,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
And you take just like a woman,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Far away and over the wall,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Honey, I will meet you there,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Is looking for a new fool,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
You'll change your last name, too,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
I'll be on my way,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
For her to arrive,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
By the night and been to some place new,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
And to come each time you call,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Precious memories, how they linger,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
You're beautiful beyond words,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I'd be sad and blue,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
To be out on your own,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
He is centuries old,
And played the fife lowly,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Oh, see what you can do,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
I can see the turning of the key,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
You don't want a love that's pure,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Who will promise never to part,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
You need something to open your eyes,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Most of the time it's well understood,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
Winter would have no spring,
And you know I could never be your own,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Thieving in the alley,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Hmm, I can make it through,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
All them prophets good and gone,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
They run a brick and tile company,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
In the little church a-this side of town,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Well, I may just swear,
The Second World War came to an end,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
They say every distance is not near,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
You married young just like your ma,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
We take great delight in our own company,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Mixing up the medicine,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
God knows there's a heaven,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
And to come every time you call,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Get back, write Braille,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
I like the way that you move your hips,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Corrina, Corrina,
In the great unknown,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
When God and man will be reconciled,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Makes no difference where she's been,
I had so much left to do,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Like a complete unknown,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
I can't be good, baby,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Don't let her hear,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
If you throw it all away,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
May you stay forever young,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
To be alone with you,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
I been good while I been waiting,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
When all will be well,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
I bless the day I found you,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
To stay closer than any friend,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Try hard, get barred,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Got my mind made up,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
You have given everything to me,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Human gods aim for their mark,
But you're doing it again,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Said I'm pressing on,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
All I really wanna do,
He won't do nothing to you,
Ain't no going back,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Drifting too far from shore,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Of this I can't say very much,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
The night would see me wide awake,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
That they do not respect in any degree,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
And I'm so glad,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
You could look at it and weep,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Baby, let me follow you down,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
But I will be back, I will survive,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Seven days,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Go away from my window,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
Hold me, baby, be near,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Keep a clean nose,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Don't wear sandals,
In the darkness of my night,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
God knows how to make it flow,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Don't try No Doz,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
I'm never, never far from home,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I got no place left to turn,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Ye shall be changed,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
But, if I will save you the time,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
I just say no thanks,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Face full of black soot,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
When there is no more,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Tell me that you love me only,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Into my own parade,
You wanna drown love,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
While riding on a train going west,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I'm going down the river,
Without ideals or violence,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
That four ears cannot hear him,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Tell her not to worry,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
It still ain't me, babe,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Eh, see what you can do,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Well, get sick, get well,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
I got my mind made up,
Roll, Willie, roll,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
It's not aimed at anyone,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Don't let yourself stumble,
God knows it's a crime,
Three angels up above the street,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
I went into the city, went into the town,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
But evidently she don't,
When you think that you've lost everything,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
It always means so much,
When I seen him lose control,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
I landed up on the downtown side,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Father of day, father of night,
To protect his white skin,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
My hands can't feel to grip,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
The country doctor rambles,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Get born, keep warm,
It could even be like a myth,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Don't let yourself fall,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Well, come all without, come all within,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
I once held her in my arms,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Waiting for the trains,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
I can make it through,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
My arms and legs were broken,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
For all intended purposes,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
But, if I can save you any time,
A man named Martin Luther King,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
To be without a home,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Giving back all of what you owe,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
I got two white horses following me,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
Now, won't you tell me true,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
You had enough of hatred,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I went down to scrub and rub,
How he died nobody can say,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
But the time ain't tall,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
On this new morning, new morning,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
I tried to reach you, honey,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
It hurts me, too,
You're beautiful to me,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Oh, in somebody's room,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Tell me,
You got something better,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Strangers all give me the news,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I'd already gone the distance,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I've been all around the world, boys,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
I went into the red, went into the black,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Heart of mine,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Tears on the letter that I write,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
If I didn't have to guess,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
It's rising up above my head,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Equality, liberty,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
We live in a political world,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Alright, I'm so glad,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
In his anger and his shame,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Baby, please stop crying,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
No direction home,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Father of time and father of dreams,
They lowered him down as a king,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
In one the surface was frozen,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Stand up straight and tall,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Adios, mi corazon,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Stone you and say good luck,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Nothing was delivered,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
I ain't looking to block you up,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Just don't know what to do,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
That her father was going to hang,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
God knows it's fragile,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Like a rolling stone,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
They must bust in early May,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
This world is ruled by violence,
Make you spin or do you in,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
The sky too is folding under you,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Give what I got until I got no more,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Trust yourself,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
The day you quit me, baby,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I'm leaving today,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
That five walls cannot hide him,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
By users, cheaters,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
The night blows cold and rainy,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
But it ain't him to blame,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
God knows it's true,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
At the close of the day,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
By rivers of blindness,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Look away, you rolling river,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I just don't see why I should even care,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
For his age he is wise,
If ever I prove false to you,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Out to the windy beach,
We'll fly the night away,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Better jump down the manhole,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Watch the river flow,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I've been around this whole country,
It always has hit me from below,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Loyalty, unity,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
"Not me," said his manager,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
How does it feel,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
I never can go because, you know,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
She said she would never forget,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Try to be a success,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
How many times have you heard someone say,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
As human gods aim for their mark,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
And I'm in the shade,
Watered-down love,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
They say that every man must fall,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Like you never did before,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Using every angle under the sun,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
They say every man must need protection,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
I been riding the midnight train,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
God knows there's a purpose,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
In love and with kindness,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
All the silver, all the gold,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Get dressed, get blessed,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
If you'd see me this way,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Don't put yourself over the line,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Says he's got a bad cough,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
With his candle lit into the sun,
I swung on to my old guitar,
And come every time you call,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
A true love of mine,
In the instant that I preach,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Some things are too hot to touch,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
A complete unknown,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
And I--I walk out on my own,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Or select you or dissect you,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
It don't matter what you did,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
No, nothing was delivered,
Well, I'm pressing on,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
And, although that we're single and free,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
The man there said he loved my sound,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Like as not, it's better so,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
She'll be coming forth,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
To know how much I really care,
Without a reply I left by the moon -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
Havanagee-luh-
Leave all the children home -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Remember me to one who lives there -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
Turn, turn, turn again -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
Democracy don't rule the world --
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
Ha-va-
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
Havana-gee-
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
First degree and second degree -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
I hope that you can hear--
Hava-na-
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
I long to hold you in the night -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
As suicide remarks are torn -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
To know where you are -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
How badly they were shocked -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
I got no idea what I want -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Whispering your secret emotion -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
You will not hear a laugh -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
I ask you how things could get much worse -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
With notions his canoe was laden -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
Oh, my-
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
That's where you belong --
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
Ten thousand miles or more -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
With no other choice except but for to go -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Private reasons - great or small -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
That can win what's a-never been won -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
Haven't seen her since that night -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
It can't be this way everywhere -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
Thank--
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
Indians camp along her border -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
I a-hope you can hear--
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
I'm sure it was not three -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
Disconnect these cables--
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
Hang out the whole next day -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
I'm ready when you are, Senor.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
Yes, tell me.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
See like me or be like me.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
The whole night through.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
You know the song in my heart.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Mortality, reality.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
Honey, I never would have come.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
For the times, they-they are a-changing.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Leave no stone unturned.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
You don't want me, give my money back.
That keep us so tightly bound.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
You're a big girl all the way.
Without a love of my own.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
All my connections too.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.

"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.

There he still sits on top of the hill.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
I'd be lost if not for you.
But you were tangled up in blue.
I'm sad and lonely too.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Hmm.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
He's always on trial for just being born.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.

You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
I had so little time to fail.
Fighting every inch of the way.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
I need a shot of love.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.

Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
With your golden loom.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.

A foreign sound to your ear.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.

And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.

And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
It ain't quite the end.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
Thank you.
For your times, they are a-changing.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Behind a man's brain.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.

Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.

She was the only daughter of the engineer.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
While my conscience explodes.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
But he sure left here in style.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
And ye shall be changed.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Honey, baby.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.

So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
Down to New Orleans.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.

Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
But I can't get close to her at all.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Know not what the years may hold.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
May you stay forever young.
Until I threw it all away.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
You'll do as much for me.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.

Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.

That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Funny way to start a picnic.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.

Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Honey, I want you.

All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.

Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
And tapestry of rhyme.
To see that you're madly in love.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
And there's no time to think.
But everybody else - even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Paths of victory we shall walk.

I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
And guarded them as they fell.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
At not getting their money's worth.
I got a woman in Jackson - oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
Don't remember one thing more.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
I see that stationmaster too.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Rode slowly back again.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
Her fond face pale with woe.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
I scarcely feel the glow.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
For she once was a true love of mine.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
Tell me that it isn't true.
In fond memory appear.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Last radio is playing.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Living down Sonora way.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
I did not do it knowingly.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Some speak of the future.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Foundationed deep somehow.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
No kindred or relative nigh.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
If you throw it all away.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
When she's better only time'll tell.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Valentines can't buy her.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
He ain't-a got no name.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
You got a heart of stone.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
"And stay all night with me.
Headed out for the western skies.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Alright, thank you.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
I took some comfort there.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Waiting on my burying ground.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Everything is gonna be alright.
For the times, they are a-changing.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
Can't see over to the other side.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
There's no words that need to be said.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
That must be what it's all about.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Evidently she won't.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
New morning.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
You are on the bottom.
I can't hear you anymore.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
Hope you're ready.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
I just can't beg you anymore.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
He's got his mother's eyes.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Just what this song is all about.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
And left me here facing the wall.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Bid farewell forever.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
In the border-towns of despair.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
'Steada acting like we never met.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Join the army if you fail.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Saying wants company.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Patriotism, materialism.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I stood wondering which way to go.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
Don't look it--like it will anytime soon.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
It's almost like-almost like I don't exist.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
They want me for a gambling fight.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
I didn't realize how young you were.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
You always got more than enough rope.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
And time is beginning to crawl.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Looking for the places only they would know.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Crying out that he been framed.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
And gives it to me for a song.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
My face you'll never see no more.
Never been so easy or so slow.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
You're a big girl now.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Someone I really could care for.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
With all these promises you left for me.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
See that my grave is kept clean.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Have fallen from her curls.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
For that's the way I remember her best.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Where teardrops fall.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
When I run outta things to investigate.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Just to take somebody's money away.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
His voice was low with pain.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
I want you.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Rain would gather, too.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
And the sails are spread.
And shot it fulla holes.
That's really and truly an American.
Standing on your window, honey - yes, I've been here before.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I don't know.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
Greenwich Village.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
And relive my dreams.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
I remember her whispering yet.
You can show me a new place to start.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
When I paint my masterpiece.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
And they gotta cut something.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
And your highway's getting filled.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Even before you came in the door.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Looking for a new friend.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
And the morning will be breaking.

Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
You break your promise all over the place.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
You'll never see me frown.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
Gal, you're on my mind.
And cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
And keep away from pranks.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
And each one I've never seen again.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
That big, old boat started to sink.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
I can walk anytime around the block.
But you're never sure why you're here.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Lay your hand upon my head.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
To anything I might have tried.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Things will be alright by and by.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
I'll only let you down.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
The time and the place that we'd part.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
To live it you had to explode.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Alright, thank you very much.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
Madams light the candles.
And it is time for me to slide.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Six by six...
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
But I never yet found Fennario.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
At the end of the trail.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
And I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Need that woman straight and true.
Oh, convey herself away.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
But you break just like a little girl.
Going through all these things twice.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Gone as the season she's taken.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Hoping you'll come through too.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Got my mind made up.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
Crying out that he was framed.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
As the present now will later be past.
But you can't see in and I--it's hard looking out.
And rivers that ran through every day.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
I can't see through it anymore.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
We all know for sure that it's real.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
I see better days and I do better things.
To see what kinda words he could say.
In the pale moonlight.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
I been in this thing too long.
Going, going, gone.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
That's the way I remember her best.
I didn't feel so cold then.
You're drifting too far from shore.
But then again-I think again-and then the-whoa-I said, oh-I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Lord, protect my child.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
Going back where we come from.
His mama sure was proud of him.
But these to tell what's true.
But the mountains of the past.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
And I--I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
If you won't come out your window.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
It's that million dollar bash.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
They would not let me be.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Adios, mi corazon.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Soft as music, light as spring.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
To hold me in your arms.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a-a diamond as big as your shoe.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Come on, darling.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Is when I'm alone with you.
And there's a slow--there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
I got a bird that sings.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Thanks.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
In the night the price was paid.
Of every man who put me here.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
But you're back where you belong.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
And disregards the rest.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
I said that.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
But I ain't neither one.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Tangled up in blue.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
I'll hold it down for you.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
It'll never do, somehow.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
The sooner you can go.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
So the radio didn't work so well.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
Broken voices on broken phones.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
The words that her lover had said.
We may not make it through the night.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
I only saw what they let me see.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
Rain would gather too.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
And she had left him to die in there.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
That last night I was with.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Feel further away than ever before.
It sure is right on a night like this.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
It only brings me sorrow.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
To anything I mighta tried.
I can't fight them anymore.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Mary wore three links of chain.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away - we're gonna forget it.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
I don't believe you.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Find out something only dead men know.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
You're bound to fall" - you thought they were all kidding you.
A-lord, protect my child.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
To know which way the wind blows.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
She's in some foreign land.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
Figuring a way to get back home.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Nothing done and nothing said.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Life don't mean a thing.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Havanageeluh.
I couldn't find any.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Hear me singing through these tears.
It don't matter, anyhow.
You want a watered-down love.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
And you only got ten.
Someone's watching over you.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Wants to get it paid off.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Ever since I seen her smile.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
You're my baby.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
You to me were the best.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
The place that I started from.
To anything I might've tried.
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
While evening slips away.
If you just let me come home with you.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he--nobody was glad.
Mama, you been on my mind.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
I know they're not what they seem.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
People sleeping in broken beds.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
And the mailbox is locked.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I don't know any more than this.
This is from the Mojave Desert.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
I don't care what in the world you do.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Step lightly on the ground.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.
But mine was a little different, you see.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Friends with you.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
I once loved a woman - a child, I am told.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Somebody better investigate soon.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
I once held her in my arms.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Don't be angry--don't be angry with me should I cry.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
But she had some way of finding them out.

Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
The next day could be your last.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
He gone north for a while.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
Like you never done before.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
While the law looks the other way.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Lay dead beside him there.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I know something is changed.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
See him at play makes me smile.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Bring that bottle over here.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Turned on my record player.
That can win what's never been won.
What some people are gonna do for money.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
I followed the winding stream.
But you're not even sure what it is.
What you'll say when you get home.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
Without ideals or violence.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
From my toes up to my ears.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
And your golden loom.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Baby, baby...
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
He never did know what it was all about.
She can't find him anywhere.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
He could die happily ever after.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
They seem determined to go all the way.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
Trying to create a next world war.
People bending broken rules.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
You're too hot, darling.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
She acts like we never met.
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
I'm falling in love with you.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
It can't be this way everywhere.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
The same as my father before him.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Because everybody must get stoned.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
Just you and me.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
In an oil refinery.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Come on, baby...
Draw conclusions on the wall.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
I'm younger than that now.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Believe me, ain't no lie.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Throw my mattress out there too.
And I's left alone with three children.
I hate bears.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
That set everybody free.
She pretends like we never have met.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Epitome, rigidity.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
You won't get it for money.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
It's just the old American way.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Come on, baby.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
And she'll only know he's dead.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
I find it so difficult to leave.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
High society, notoriety.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
Just what he was talking about.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
I hope I'm ready.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
I seen a man.
Will no--not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Yes, and I'll go last.
I can't fire them anymore.
What he gets he must pay for - he don't get it out of love.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
And he was a friend of mine.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
That Johanna's not here.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
That number eleven was closing.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
"Get well, get well," said she.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Put me outta doors.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
But I ain't got Corrina.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
If I ride back again.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
It was you who understood.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
"Don't trill no news on me.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing - I just might tell you the truth.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
Got ice water in my veins.
Using ideas as my maps.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
To make me think I'm wrong.
If you just let me follow you down.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Said it was a bad dream.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
And I need you, ah.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
The way you walk and the way you talk - I feel I could almost sing.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
Without this love that we call ours.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
I never saw the man again.
From the little Minnesota town.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
And get something quick to eat.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
I shall be released.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
Sound like it's on a final run.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
Is gonna be against the law.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
And say you'll always let it be me.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Someone who will die for you and more.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
Humility, simplicity.
Mine alone.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl - and me - oh, God! - I'm a one.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
"Don't point your finger at me.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
I used to care, but things have changed.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Or put up against the wall.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
And then go on home and have my fun.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.

Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
68, but says he's 24.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
I just can't keep from crying.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
Now they say it's the land of money.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
The light I never knowed.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
And the people that confronted him were many.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
The last radio is playing.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Right now I'm having trouble.
I will only let you down.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
You have no idea what you do to me.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
Crumble into one another.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
I'm not the one you need.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
And I-I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
And make promises by the hours.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
His epitaph plain:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Serve somebody:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Till I come into New York town:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
But there's one promise, darling:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Make promises by the hour;
I find complete love;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Had to be held down by big police;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
So many things that we never will undo;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Crumble into one another;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Some speak of the future;
All lies and jest;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Where did you lose your wings?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
How come you don't send me no regards?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Are you the same person that was here before?
What can I give to You?
How does it feel?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
What's wrong with you this time?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Must everybody bow?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Before they're forever banned?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
How many compared to yesterday?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
And how does it feel?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
How's everything in heaven?
Just like a rolling stone?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Did you respect me for what I did?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
When he's standing in front of you?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
What would life be?
Baby, what more can I tell?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Does anyone even try?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
When did you leave heaven?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
How many more without any reward?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
Why and what's the reason for?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
What do you think about that, my friend?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Why would I want to take your life?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Am I ready?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
What can I do for You?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
How can I live for You?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
And one deserving of affection?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Poor boy, where you been?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Baby, can I come home with you?
For all these earthly things?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
How could they ever mistake you?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Can I come home with you?
Before he can hear people cry?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
By golly, what more can I say?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Before they're allowed to be free?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
Who you thought you were talking to?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Of everything you see?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Can you get back in?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Too many people have died?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
What good am I?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Before you call him a man?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
How many more can they afford?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Are you ready?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
What?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Has anybody seen my love?
Where did you hide your halo?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
How much poison did they inhale?
How could they let you go?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
That too many people have died?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Across the swooping plain?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Have they missed you?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
What else can a poor boy do?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Across the swamp of time?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Ready, George?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Baby, can't you tell?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Gal, where you been so long?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Am I still dreaming yet?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
To love and follow His direction?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Before he can see the sky?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
So I can know if I'm really real?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Like a rolling stone?
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
Well, the dog collar's from India
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Just what you had in mind
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
I will not go down under the ground
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Now you don't act so--so proud
For what you sold that's not been received
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Nothing was delivered
And that even the nobles get properly handled
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
"Equality". I spoke the word
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
There ain't nothing in this world
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And then you told me later as I apologized
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Things would be different the next time we wed
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
They took a clean-cut kid
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Now, whenever I get up and
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
Now, a very great man once said
You used to be so amused
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
To see him obviously framed
We live in a political world
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
But something has changed
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
By no special friend
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Maybe someday you will understand
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Silvio, silver and gold
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
How many times can a man turn his head
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
It's something you did
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Many times I've often prayed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Somebody seen him hanging around
But now something has changed
But she ain't gonna find the road
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
I've been walking around
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Then came the warning that was before the flood
I thought that it was well-understood
I had to say something to strike him very weird
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
You used--be so proud
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
And those whom doom and death had spared
Now you don't seem so proud
As I stand upon the sand
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
The changes I was going through can't even be used
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
She let go of my hand
I'll always thank the Lord
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
He was a clean-cut kid
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
While some, on principles baptized
So I'll make my stand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
Its iron claws attached
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
All the sweethearts you can hold
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And into the path you are hurled
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
I live in another world
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Everything stays down where it's wounded
I want you, baby, just to understand
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
And your trouble is you know it too good
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
I run right home and I went to bed
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
And things would be different the next time we wed
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
As he rises to fame
The crashing waves roll over me
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
You say you're looking for someone
When the rain is blowing in your face
You know, it's not even safe no more
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Remember me to the one who lives there
What good am I then to others and me
Leaving men wholly, totally free
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Why wait any longer for the one you love
So, I called up the operator of time
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Hunger pays a heavy price
Lies that life is black-and-white
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
When I'm all alone
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Up into some paradise
On the rising curve
And the Negro's name
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
And I would send a message
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Most of the time I can't even be sure
"It's only you that he does crave
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
She been gone
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Should I leave them by your gate
You just pick anyone
Well, it's all new to me
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Taking care of somebody nice
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
I rode with him in a taxi once
That she's the same one
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
So I look like a walking mountain range
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
You cut to the core
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
But I feel nothing for their game
And plenty time for good romance
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
What's probably got you baffled more
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
I am homeless, come and take me
I been wondering all about me
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I do declare
Little did I realize
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
They say don't come back no more
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
"That I might be gone a long, old time
You smiling through the fence at me
Says it's closing time
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Limited in sex they dare
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Should I put them by your gate
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
While them that defend what they cannot see
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
So up she picked her babies three
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
It's all new to me
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
But I can get another one
Better stay away from those
Waiting to find out what price
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
If dogs run free, then what must be
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Feel to moan, but unlike before
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
From all the plans they do pursue
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
A girl who would murder her own, true love
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Mona tried to tell me
Though its shadow's metal badge
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
And you see why it's so unique to be
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
And I ain't complaining none
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Knows there's no success like failure
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Where I could watch her waltz for free
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
I don't even notice she gone
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
But it won't be over till they clear his name
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
And never sat once at the head of the table
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Among the lovely people living free
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
The man the authorities came to blame
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Breaking hearts up and down the line
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
I can survive and I can endure
To give the special one you seek a chance
He'll see by his grave
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
The cause was there before we came
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
And suddenly there appeared before me
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
What about that millionaire
I'm ready for to fade
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
You're not free to belong to me
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
If dogs run free, why not me
We see this empty cage now corrode
Remember me to one who lives there
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
You into thinking you're the one
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
How many ears must one man have
All I feel is heat and flame
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
And I'm just the same as anyone else
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Just what you will say when you get home
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
When the roses fade
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
There were times when I was so lonesome
Well, six white horses that you did promise
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
She knows there's no success like failure
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
From the start by the rule
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Everybody's wearing a disguise
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Looking at hands for the lines that were
To show you something you seen before
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Just pick anyone
From the Golden Gate Bridge
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Full of hope and desire
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
But I can't say I sympathize
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
With all memory and fate
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
She plunged him into well water where
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
You said you'd never compromise
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
A bed that is never mine
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
What you're gonna say when you get home
If dogs run free, why not we
How was I to know you'd be the one
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
At dawn my lover comes to me
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
So I remember every face
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
It'll be with me unto the grave
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
But the dark does die
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Everybody sees hisself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
They're drinking up and walking
Well, I set my monkey on the log
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And the cards are no good that you're holding
She rode by night and came by morning
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
For your weary toes to be a-touching
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And there's no telling who that it's naming
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
'Cause the battle outside raging
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
The order is rapidly fading
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
The order is a-rapidly fading
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Where the time and the tempo drag
The battle outside raging
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
I can hear their hearts a-beating
What am I saying? What am I knowing
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
There's nothing in here moving
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
If I was with her too long
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
It's not a bad way to make a living
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Deceived me into thinking
Beyond here lies nothing
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
But then a whistle will be blowing
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
For your weary toes to be touching
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Girls' faces formed the forward path
You go north and you go south
Look out, the saints are coming through
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
And how I know I'll make it through
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Then she told us how times were tough
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
I have fallen far beneath
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Well, there ain't no going back
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
You turn around to take a final peek
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Shoot in the back
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Make everything from toy guns that spark
I wish she'd unlock
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
But they caught him and they brought him back
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Her voice once and talk
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
The man in me will do nearly any task
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
As the last fire-truck from hell
Ring bar, hard to tell
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
I chased me a woman up the hill
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Muttering small talk at the wall
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
And if my love is real
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Oh, how does it feel
Ring bell, hard to tell
Then why don't she tell
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
A girl by the whirlpool
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
All and all can only fall
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
But among the dead that were left on the hill
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
They ask me how I feel
How many seas must the white dove sail
Soul to soul our shadows roll
He's sure got a lot of gall
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
A-how does it feel
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
How does it feel
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
He's taught in his school
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
How many seas must a white dove sail
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Two eyes took the aim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
But I can hear another drum
So, one morning when the sun was warm
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
"For you cannot relive them
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And remain as I am
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
You better not chew gum
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Poor boy in a red-hot town
I'll be waiting at the station
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
My love, she's like some raven
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Darkness at the break of noon
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Well, you fake just like a woman
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
"Not me," said the gambling man
To remember the times when I was your only man
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
I don't even care if I ever see her again
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
A-she takes just like a woman
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
From heights that they could not gain
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
I figure maybe we're even
And the corner sign
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
The next morning she had awoken
Uncle Rat went running downtown
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
All lay down their bandanas and complain
For the loser now will be later to win
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Why did you trade heaven
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
She got such a sweet disposition
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Guns and clubs followed him down
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
But me, I expected it to happen
Well, I'm hanging on
But all their daughters put me down
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Yes, and someone must explain
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
The foreign sun, it squints upon
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Yet I swear I see my reflection
You need something to make it known
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Somebody new to beat on
She said that all the railroad men
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Trying to get a lead on
She takes just like a woman
That long, black train is pulling on down
How many roads must a man walk down
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
How can the life of such a man
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Must meet the dawn
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Out of the shower comes a football man
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
As you sit on the box you keep him in
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
But I swear I see my reflection
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
You don't need a weatherman
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
But it's hard to think on
But the second mother was with the seventh son
The ones that jump on the wagon
To my knowledge there's just one man
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
But the post office has been stolen
And you ache a-just like a woman
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Will not be understood as they're spoken
He got that fortress on the mountain
In ceremonies of the horsemen
And she aches just like a woman
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
There was little to say, there was no conversation
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
For the loser now might be later to win
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And all their daughters put me down
Their religion of the little ten women
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Suicide remarks are torn
Nothing we can call our own
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Advertising signs that con
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
And there's no exit in any direction
In the pigpen
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Have died in battle or in vain
That long, black train is pulling down
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
And she wakes just like a woman
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
You take just like a woman
All their daughters put me down
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Silvio, I gotta go
There's nothing you can say or do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Every place I wanna go
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
There is a place you go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
All I'd like you to do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
All I really wanna do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Aladdin and his lamp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
How many times must a man look up
I walked down there and ended up
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
The man in the coon-skin cap
Man in the coon-skin cap
What good am I while you softly weep
Still I say her love-words over
So, don't fear if you hear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
In one I was running and in another
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
All you boys better run for cover
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
For all eternity I think I will remember
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I don't even think about her
I could feel a whole lot better
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
But morning is clear
The face of God will appear
The lover who has just walked out your door
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Alone you stand with nobody near
The wind howls like a hammer
Never no more do I wonder
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
You heard me saying a prayer for
When you whispered in my ear
At any moment you could go under
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
She took him by his long, yellow hair
Who came here from Cuba's door
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
When only you are near
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Still I've always kind of missed her
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
I say, "Why you say that for
My ship is in the harbor
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
I close my eyes and I wonder
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
I don't have to go far
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Mama, you know, awaits the news
At times I think there are no words
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
To memorizing politics
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
I try to tell it like it is
I let it slip gladly to my friends
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
As friends and other strangers
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
He's not selling any alibis
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Girl by the whirlpool's
I was thinking of a series of dreams
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And tells me of her dreams
Seven days
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
I'd gladly confess
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Don't follow leaders
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Good and bad, I define these terms
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
The empty-handed painter from your streets
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
You never turned around to see the frowns
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Six-time users
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
But still remains
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
What good am I if I say foolish things
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
But, though the masters make the rules
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And inside it with the people made of molasses
With a big bouquet of the roses
Wants eleven dollar bills
Don't wear sandals
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And I try to harmonize with songs
You know that he has no intentions
Romantic facts of musketeers
People carry roses
Six-time losers
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I'm gonna let you pass
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
True love can make a blade of grass
Statues made of matchsticks
Her window's wide open, African trees
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
And the poor white remains
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Well, the ragman draws circles
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
We living in times when men commit crimes
They whisper in the wings
That it's you and no one else that owns
And your father, to your sister he explains
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And so Patty calls the cops
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
And, though the masters make the rules
You been hurt so many times
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
In the dimestores and bus-stations
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Glide across the lonely years
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
When your mother sends back all your invitations
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Thinking of a series of dreams
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
To sharpen the senses
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
To the cutting of fences
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
You can fall down on your knees
How many deaths will it take till he knows
You should be made to wear earphones
The cowboy angel rides
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
And then complains
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
People on the platforms
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Now, you must provide some answers
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
And the princess and the prince discuss
On the back of the fish truck that loads
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
How many years can some people exist
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Everyone still talks about
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Someday, everything is gonna be different
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
And I, in my armor, turning about
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
So he never thinks straight
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
You used to laugh about
They tell me revenge is sweet
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Wait for the morning light
One more night the moon is shining bright
He really wasn't where it's at
Well, early in the morning till late at night
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
To hold each other tight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
I'm on the pavement
Every new messenger bringing evil report
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Johnny's in the basement
One more night I will wait for the light
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
They tell me to be discreet
Plants in the bed, but
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
You're hearing my heart beat
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
The slowest now will later be fast
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Without any doubt
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
I think that it's best
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
But, if the arrow is straight
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
In the precious winds they rot
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
By the way, that's a cute hat
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Yet you know there is no answer fit
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Keep me set apart
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
He built a fire on Main Street
You're gonna get hit
In the stillness of the midnight
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And, since my feet are now fast
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
You don't forget
That might be all that you got
I got into the driver's seat
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
You used to laugh-make fun about
With your pockets well protected at last
How many years can a mountain exist
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
It don't take too long to find out
You are there in the flickering light
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Talking that the heat put
Everything is always right
I soon get some rest
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
To keep it in your mind and not forget
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I'm moving after midnight
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
She seems too far out
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
There's some people that
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
And the first one now will later be last
The slow one now will later be fast
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And I tell this truth to you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To protect you and defend you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I'll remember you
I just might have to come see you
It's just crazy being here with you
I can be just like you
To be alone with you
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
He been living there three years now
Well, I'd sure like to know
Don't it always go to show
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Sooner or later one of us must know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
It only goes to show
Down every street there's a window
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
I'd sure like to know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
With only you in view
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
The only one I know
Don't it always a-go to show
Yes, I'd sure like to know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
But sooner or later one of us must know
Is worth more than I could pay
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And for His love they took His life away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
For them that must obey authority
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
She smiles, walks the other way
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
A cock is crowing far away
Went to the doctor the very next day
That I was just a puppet in a play
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
From phony jealousy
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
The Spanish-American War had its day
For them that think death--death's honesty
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
To those condemned to act accordingly
For them that think death's honesty
So they took him to the infirmary
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Maggie says that many say
No, you'll not now or no other day
But you can never steal away
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
So I run down most hurriedly
Don't you tell Henry
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Or if you just want some company
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
I send you all my money
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
I did not do it harmfully
If I don't take the chance to try
Though I'd never say
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
That I done it the way
Well, I saw it advertised one day
She puts it to me plain as day
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
We banged the drum slowly
And the ladies treat me kindly
She knocked upon it anyway
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Spouted out that liberty
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And that which you've given me today
My mind weaves a symphony
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
And the only tune my guitar could play
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
How many times must the cannon balls fly
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
My ears hear a symphony
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
And it's up to you to say
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Well, I'm walking down the highway
But I wish there was something you would do or say
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
But I can't deny
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
The same thing I would want today
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
So, I'm walking down your highway
