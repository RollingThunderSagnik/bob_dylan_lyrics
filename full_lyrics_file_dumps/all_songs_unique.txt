"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!

She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!

Get me outta here, my dear man!
Well!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Hootenanny television!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
I wanna be yours!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Yes, come out your window!

Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Woo-hoo!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Take me down to California, baby!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
So write to her tenderly."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Tangled up in blue."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
I'll bring back my lady."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
And keep him good company."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
We want folksingers here."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
I didn't see you around."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
Come flowing down so free?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
You can't blame us at all."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
I can't find my knees."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"That way down Highway 61."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
They look as dark as night."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
It's all for the love of thee."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
You and I'll never know."
But I know what you want."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
And hung on a willow tree."
Has kindly assisted me home."
He said, "Tell me about it."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
You must know about my debutante."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
You say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
From across that lonesome ocean."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Where you and I will unite."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
God said, "On Highway 61."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
For that reason I will have to stay."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
And pretend that you never have met."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
That you must always first forgive them."
And says, "Here's your throat back, thanks for the loan."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
I would want again tomorrow."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
I'll endow them onto thee."
We'll both go off together."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Country'll grow."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I'll see her soon, I know."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
And you say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
Have it on Highway 61."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
And punched my cigarette."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Would kill a little bird like me."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
And have it on Highway 61."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
But we were tangled up in blue."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
You can't blame me at all."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
I love far better than thee."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
We'll both go home together."
"Is it easy to forget?"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
They look as white as snow."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
And it's all for the love of thee."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Will mourn for your return."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
It's rising up above my head,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Far away from it all,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
She leave by the other and roam,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
May you stay forever young,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
You need something to open up a new door,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
You broke a heart that loved you,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Strike another match, go start anew,
They say every man must fall,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
They say every man must need protection,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Forever young, forever young,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
And played the fife lowly,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
I'm leaving today,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Trust yourself,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to,
Using every angle under the sun,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
As the present now will later be past,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
They say every distance is not near,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
The night would see me wide awake,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
This situation can only get rougher,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
I once held her in my arms,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
But I will be back, I will survive,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Wintertime in New York town,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
They must bust in early May,
Who could they get to carry you,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
They say every man need protection,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Three by three they're turning the key,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
But evidently she don't,
Don't let her know,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
To be so useless and all,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Drifting too far from shore,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
While paupers change possessions,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Seven days,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
It always means so much,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
That one doctor cannot save him,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Going, going,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You got to serve somebody,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
So glad,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
That five walls cannot hide him,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Looking for a new fool,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Like a rolling stone,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
That her father was going to hang,
Like as not, it's better so,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Trouble,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
To a solid rock,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
I need a shot of love,
She's crying like an evil stone,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Relationships of ownership,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
You don't want a love that's pure,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Says he's got a bad cough,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
No, nothing was delivered,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Now, lamp-gates and <i>[incomprehensible]</i>, I can recite 'em all,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Ten thousand men on the move,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
If you'd see me this a-way,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Most of the time it's well understood,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Mercury, gravity,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Try hard, get barred,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
People going down to the ground,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I like the way that you move your hips,
To be on your own,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Six months on the chain gang,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
A dream about you, baby,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
I've been in and out of happiness,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Tell me that you love me only,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
All you can do is do what you must,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Couldn't even see the floor,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
God don't call it treason,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
She's opened up a happy home,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
But you were gambling for support,
By users, cheaters,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
And not going through any great extreme,
They––they show me to the door,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Father of night, father of day,
Don't steal, don't lift,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
A true love of mine,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Oh, Angelina,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
In the turning of twilight,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
You even make love just like a woman,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
And gathering storms may arise,
I don't wanna fake you out,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
I just don't know what to do,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
The Second World War came to an end,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Stripping away at it all,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Went back home to the yard,
And you take just like a woman,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Going,
Spent my money on you, honey,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Holding his club like he was a king,
You made it there somehow,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Laying low,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Don't try No Doz,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
And furnish me with tape,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Silvio, I gotta go,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I got my mind made up,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Go away from my window,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
You want watered-down love,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Need a woman all the time,
When there is no more,
I have no one to meet,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
I'm going out of my mind,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Look away, you rolling river,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
And the point is slick,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
To be––direction home,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
God knows there's a heaven,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Silhouetted by the sea,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
There she come, now, down my way,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Thank You, Lord,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
You could look at it and weep,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
They tell me every man must fall,
If not for you,
To hide 'neath a hood,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Bring the wife and family,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Heart of mine, be still,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
You were striped, you were plain,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
My limbs are shaking,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
The beat is pumping,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
The night passed away so quickly,
At the close of the day,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
I just keep pressing on,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
My existence led by confusion boats,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
And I know what you're thinking of,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
I been good,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
All them prophets good and gone,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
To shine in through,
Tell her not to worry,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
On the stone that remains,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
And the sooner you come up with them,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Hmm, I can make it through,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
You don't have to feed me,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
I can't cross the line, you know,
How he died nobody can say,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
But I'm saved,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
You have explained every mystery,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Searching high, searching low,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Hold me, baby, be near,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
So unknown,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Well, the way I love that woman,
He been around the world and back again,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Up and down the block,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
But, it ain't me, babe,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
With what your fate is going to be,
Don't let her see,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Got my mind made up,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
That the laws are with him,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Resent him to the bone,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Going home,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
You have given everything to me,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Watch the plain-clothes,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
I just can't beg you anymore,
True love of mine,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Of this I can't say very much,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
And you know I could never be your own,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Father who build the mountain so high,
God sees it all unfold,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
And it's only that I'm asking,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
But you try with your whole soul,
You'll change your last name, too,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Go down to the river, babe,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Just like I did before,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
But it ain't him to blame,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
And I got the worried blues,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
If anything is gonna sell,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Yet every distance is not near,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I never can go because, you know,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
But it ain't me, babe,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Vanished from my hand,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
The kingdoms of experience,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
I've been all around the world, boys,
People talk of situations,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Where life and death are memorized,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Dream about you, baby,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Yes, I'm so glad,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Don't let yourself stumble,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
I ain't looking to block you up,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Three angels up above the street,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
We never much thought we could get very old,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
On this new morning, new morning,
A handle hid out in the dark,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Now, won't you tell me true,
To be out on your own,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
They lowered him down as a king,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
For her to arrive,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
But he can't be blamed,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Take the motherless children off the street,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
He's the property of Jesus,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
You can hear them tires squeal,
All I really wanna do,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Just don't know what to do,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
With a killer's pride, security,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
For all intended purposes,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
My love, she speaks like silence,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Don't let yourself fall,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Keep a clean nose,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
In love and with kindness,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
And to come every time you call,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
You and me, we had completeness,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
So many roads, so much at stake,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
If I didn't have to guess,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Light yourself a candle,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Don't tie no bows,
To strict party-platform ties,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Someone to close his heart,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
I long to see you in the morning light,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
That long, black train is pulling down,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Friends with you,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
But, if you want me to,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Seem like I been down this way before,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
I got those worried blues,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
I just say no thanks,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Out to the windy beach,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
The country doctor rambles,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
It hurts me, too,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
I got a wife and five little children,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Nothing was delivered,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
And I don't want to drag you down,
You gotta look some other place,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
The sky too is folding over you,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
A man named Martin Luther King,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
And also by his feet,
But it would not be new,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Better jump down a manhole,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Don't wanna be a bum,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Without a love of my own,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Aim well, my little one,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
You married young just like your ma,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Don't let me drift too far,
They keep it all hid,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Get born, keep warm,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
My hands didn't touch him none,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Every brain is civilized,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
To find out if she's talked,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Mixing up the medicine,
People carry roses,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
You're beautiful to me,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
We take great delight in our own company,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
The light I never knowed,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
She got great big hind legs,
Father of black, father of white,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
A complete unknown,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
I'd only have to stay,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Name of Martin Luther King,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
It all seemed so well-timed,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
That foreign sound in your ear,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Alright, I'm so glad,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
She never does me wrong,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Don't ever try to change me,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
You'll be doing society a favor,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
And the whole world is on your case,
Ye shall be changed,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
You can raise up your right hand,
But, to remain as friends,
I bless the day I found you,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Never weak, but always strong,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
You to me were true,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
God knows it's fragile,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Look out, kid,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Baby, let me follow you down,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
That can do what's never been done,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
I got two white horses following me,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
I threw it all away,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Over the hills and far away,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
I try my best to be like I am,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
I can't understand,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
You have given me eyes to see,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I'm going down the river,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Someone to open each and every door,
Ain't no going back,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
One by one until there were none,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Oh, see what you can do,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
You were snow, you were rain,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Well, come all without, come all within,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Honey, I will meet you there,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
One by one they followed the sun,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
He's not selling any alibis,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Made before the foundation of the world,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Heart of mine,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
One by one they follow the sun,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Corrina, Corrina,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
May be an actor in a plot,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
You have given me life to live,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Stay away from the train line,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Advertising signs, they con,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
A man with a badge skips by,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
If ever I prove false to you,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Is used, it is plain,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
The night blows cold and rainy,
That must be what it's all about,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
He is centuries old,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
You will be alright, girl,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Speaking to some French girl,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Oh, singing just for you,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
To your tambourine in time,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
In the end,
One more night the stars are in sight,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Stone you and say good luck,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Far away in the stormy night,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I won't have my nature way,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
They took a clean-cut kid,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
With his candle lit into the sun,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Too serious to fool,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
She'll surely turn to white,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Said I'm pressing on,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Hmm, see what you can do,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I'd already gone the distance,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
I know I can't win,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
God knows when,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
In the foggy web of destiny,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
I'll go see them come down my way,
My arms and legs were broken,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Is looking for a new fool,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
The day you quit me, baby,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Makes no difference where she's been,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
I'm so glad,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Without your sweet love,
And think they're fooling you,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
The air is getting hotter,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Hang around the ink-well,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Fare thee well but for a while,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Every head is so dignified,
They say every man needs protection,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I landed up on the downtown side,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Five by five they tried to survive,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Don't wear sandals,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Don't put yourself over the line,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Go melt back in the night,
And give him back the time he's done,
I think we better talk this over,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
With no direction home,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Cares not to come up any higher,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Better jump down the manhole,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Had no one to go my bail,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Don't let her know that you love her,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
And every cause that ever I fought,
It's a price I have to pay,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Ye shall be a-changed,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
When she lays upon the grass,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Adiós, mi corazón,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
From their fates try to resign,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
God knows it's true,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
With the juice running down my leg,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
The sky too is folding under you,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
To be alone with you,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
We'll go out and see it sometime. We'll both just sit there and stare,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
How he died nobody could say,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Is it really any wonder,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
You have given all there is to give,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
The phone's tapped anyway,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
I've been around this whole country,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Precious angel under the sun,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Searching everywhere I know,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
They say that every man must fall,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
My love, she speaks softly,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
You had enough of hatred,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
As human gods aim for their mark,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Madams light the candles,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
And, if I see the day,
Ever since I been a child,
God knows everything,
Don't you tell Henry,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
I'd give you the sky high above,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
I want you,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
In the instant that I preach,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
You always responded when I needed your help,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Never did feel this way before,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
By losers, cheaters,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Oh, watered-down love,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Father of minutes, father of days,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
It was from her ship sailing,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
That two healers cannot heal him,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
You wanna drown love,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I been good while I been waiting,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Every moon is so sanctified,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
And to come each time you call,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Just to know that you are near,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
I should have left this town this morning,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Waiting for the trains,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
And joined the John Birch Society,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Serve somebody,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Can't find what I need,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
He's young and on fire,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Father of loneliness and pain,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Where mercy walks the plank,
And it's like I ain't here,
Oxford Town around the bend,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
All the silver, all the gold,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Looking 'bout the government,
Carved next to his name,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Over your senses you have no control,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
To hang and to lynch,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Who among them would try to impress you,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
To have––be on your own,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Well, I'm pressing on,
A thousand miles from home,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
But, if I can save you any time,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Want you so bad,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Well, there ain't no going back,
I can't be good, baby,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
God knows you've got to weep,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
The wind howls like a hammer,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
You've got to serve somebody,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Where I will always be renewed,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
The country music station plays soft,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Just like a rolling stone,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
She would have married me,
To keep up his hate,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Watered-down love,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Whether you are right or wrong,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
"Come along and take a trip,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
But now morning is clear,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
In the great unknown,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
And here I sit so patiently,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Like a complete unknown,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
A million faces at my feet,
I'm never, never far from home,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
I can change, I swear,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Like a dog on a chain,
Eh, singing just for you,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Or select you or dissect you,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
That you'd have liked me to,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Tell me,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
He won't do nothing to you,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
And I'm back in the rain,
And it ain't me, babe,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Icicles hanging down,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
There's always someone who understands,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
But, deep inside my heart,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Thinking about the government,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Precious father, loving mother,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
In one the surface was frozen,
While riding on a train going west,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Read books and repeat quotations,
"Not me," said his manager,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
People talk over situations,
Look who's back in town,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Give you my money, honey,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Watch the river flow,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
A question in your nerves is lit,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
To protect his white skin,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Make you spin or do you in,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
She's the worst you could ever have,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
How does it feel,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
And I'm just like that bird,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Far away and over the wall,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
For something that he never done,
God knows it's terrifying,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
And forget my pride,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
God knows there's a purpose,
I been riding the midnight train,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
The one we can see and can feel,
You're beautiful beyond words,
And pretend that we never have touched,
As his youth now unfolds,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Winter would have no spring,
Strangers all give me the news,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
In the lonely night,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
It always has hit me from below,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Equality, liberty,
My dear, sweet friend,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
They say everything can be replaced,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
By rivers of blindness,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Since you've been gone,
May be living in another country under another name,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
But something has changed,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
And ye shall be a-changed,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Pick you up every time you fall,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Don't let her hear,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
This world is ruled by violence,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
I get my sweet reward,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Got me a secret membership card,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Saved,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
It could even be like a myth,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Get dressed, get blessed,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
And may you stay forever young,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
You got something better,
I got the worried blues,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
She said she would always stay,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
It don't matter what you did,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
When the night comes falling,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
God knows that, when you see it,
I just don't see why I should even care,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I thank the Lord,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Giving back all of what you owe,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
And I'm in the shade,
Circled by the circus sands,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
If you must cling to someone,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
God knows how to make it flow,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
At ships with tattooed sails,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
And there's two white horses following me,
The man in the trench-coat,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Staying far behind without you,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
But I'm pressing on,
In the hills of mystery,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I got no place left to turn,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
In the darkness of my night,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Want you,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
And your streets are getting empty,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Just then the order came to charge,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Too noble to neglect,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Well, I may just swear,
So I got those worries blues,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
For his age he is wise,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
More people kept a-piling on,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
As I travel down life's pathway,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Broken switches, broken gates,
In the shadows of moonlight,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
I would not feel so all alone,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Keep me where you are,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
I shall be released,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Why she did go,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Badge out, laid off,
And you make love just like a woman,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
It's really something,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
And, on their promises of paradise,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Love that's pure no accident,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Get back, write Braille,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
My senses have been stripped,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
If your time to you is worth saving,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
I'd be sad and blue,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Each time we meet, love,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Carry the New York Times,
The joint is jumping,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
But the time ain't tall,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
In his anger and his shame,
Says he's got a bad bill,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Like some mystery,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Watching the river flow,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
It's alright,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Who will promise never to part,
Front door shut, back door too,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Automobile coming into style,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
That can do what's a-never been done,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Father of cold and father of heat,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Don't let me change my heart,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Each one playing a horn,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
God don't call it wrong,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
For the wise men and the fools,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Don't let her see that you need her,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
I can make it through,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
New morning,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
To be without a home,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
That fellow who never blushes,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
And, although that we're single and free,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Try to be a success,
And, if I can save you any time,
I went down where the vultures feed,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Stone you when you are young and able,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
God knows there's a chance,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Baby, please stop crying,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
My woman's never sitting at home,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
I'm gonna let you pass,
For the politician's gain,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Loyalty, unity,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
She said she would never forget,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
I want my arms around you,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Now you don't talk so loud,
But, if I will save you the time,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Like you never did before,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
I went into the city, into the town,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
And I got those worried blues,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
That four ears cannot hear him,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Newspapermen eating candy,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
God knows it's a struggle,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
And, though the line is cut,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
And I'm so glad,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
It still ain't me, babe,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Yesterday is just a memory,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Made of silver or of golden,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
God knows it's outta sight,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
If you'd see me this way,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I can see the turning of the key,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
She'll be coming forth,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Joey, Joey,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
You got something I want plenty of,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Pressing on,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
And it still ain't me, babe,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Or have done something wrong,
But ye shall be a-changed,
We've killed each one,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
And the table's full and overflowed,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Gonna serve somebody,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
In a pine box for all eternity,
And point away from the past,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
You say my kisses are not like his,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Come all without, come all within,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
But I've been hanging on,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
True love, they've been without it,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
You can run down to the desert,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Simplify you, classify you,
Ah, get sick, get well,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Well, I'm so glad,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Four by four, no illusion for,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Eh, see what you can do,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I tried to reach you, honey,
To gather flowers constantly,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
She once was a true love of mine,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
That they do not respect in any degree,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
But the bottles are done,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
My woman needs it every day,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I found my world, found my world in you,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
So, never leave me lonely,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
When you think that you've lost everything,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
And she aches just like a woman,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
I wish tonight were here,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Nothing too very scientific,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Thieving in the alley,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Father of air and father of trees,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Love don't have any place,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
I'm going back to Colorado,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
When all will be well,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Without ideals or violence,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
You better chew gum,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
You find God in the church of your choice,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Without a dream in my heart,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
I rambled out of New York town,
God knows it's a crime,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
I'll be on my way,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Broken hands on broken plows,
A hand set the spark,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Not the end, not the end,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
I went out last night to take a little round,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
I run right home and I went to bed,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Don't matter what you did,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
May be the head of some big TV network,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
But I know that he don't talk,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
With his fist in a clinch,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
They don't believe in mercy,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
If'n you don't know by now,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Well, well, well,
Memory, ecstasy,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
We live in a political world,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
To know how much I really care,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Tears on the letter that I write,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Face full of black soot,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
God knows there's a river,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
But you're doing it again,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
See you fly or watch you die,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
To stay closer than any friend,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
And come every time you call,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
The day would surely have to break,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Going, going, gone,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
If she ain't feeling well,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
When I seen him lose control,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Grandpa died last week,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Analyze you, categorize you,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
I got a bird that whistles,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
And on the highway of regret,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
I want you so bad,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Stand up straight and tall,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
And she'll be coming forth,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
For she ain't the same,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
"Not I," said the referee,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
First degree and second degree,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Private reasons, great or small,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
And, if anybody asks me,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
China doll, alcohol,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
You stole her love from me one day,
It's too bad he had to go,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Day you quit me, baby,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Went to the station down in the yard,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Father of day, father of night,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
It's like I ain't here,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
When I was in Missouri,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Under the microscope,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I had no one for to go my bail,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Get jailed, jump bail,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Well, get sick, get well,
The only son of God Almighty,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
I had so much left to do,
Of ancient history,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
We'll fly the night away,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
If you throw it all away,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
The winter would hold no spring,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Don't follow leaders,
And all of your children start to resent you,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
You need something to open your eyes,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
It was you who came right through,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
That fired the gun,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
That's where you belong --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Democracy don't rule the world --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
In an oil refinery.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
But my heart just won't give in.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
And I'll rock you too.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
You give something up for everything you gain.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
By the saving grace that's over me.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
The time and the place that we'd part.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
Someone who will die for you and more.
Come on, honey.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Under the midnight moon.
I'm just average, common too.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
But she had some way of finding them out.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
I hope I'm ready.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Well, I'm just thumping.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Headed out for the western skies.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
To see what kinda words he could say.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Means another poor boy is underground.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
And relive my dreams.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
I stood wondering which way to go.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Every link was Jesus's name.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
All because of the color of his skin.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Is gonna be against the law.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.

And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
Just you and me.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
She can't find him anywhere.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
For she once was a true love of mine.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
Yes, tell me.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
From the little Minnesota town.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Now you don't talk so loud.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
She said she would always stay.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Hope you're ready.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
I had so little time to fail.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
It would go up against every rule.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
The light I never knowed.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
It sure is right on a night like this.

'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.

Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
She's in some foreign land.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Lord, protect my child.
I can't hear you anymore.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.

There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
"Don't point your finger at me.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
"Get well, get well," said she.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
But mine was a little different, you see.
And ye shall be changed.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.

Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
I would only let you down.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
You sound like a hillbilly.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Baby, baby...
Everybody must get stoned.
My face you'll never see no more.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.

It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
In the palace of the Pope.

He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.

Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
You could make me cry if you don't know.

That he needs you to test his inventions.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
And the pearls are from Japan.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.

Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
With the golden loom.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
I'm younger than that now.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
The night will soon be gone.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
To anything I mighta tried.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
So I beg you: let it be me.
No kindred or relative nigh.
But you're never sure why you're here.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
You can make it too.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
You can say I didn't give to you.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
At not getting their money's worth.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Nobility, humility.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
With all these promises you left for me.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
Funny way to start a picnic.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
Everything is gonna be alright.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
I long to reach for you in the night.
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks.
Dollar a day's worth.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Some place so high above this wall.
You won't get it for money.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Come on, darling.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Heart of mine.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
And one day he came passing by.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
I had something to protect.
And no time to think.
We were the wrong side.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Rain would gather, too.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
She acts like we never met.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Don't remember one thing more.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Leave no stone unturned.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
You are on the bottom.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
She pretends like we never have met.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
You don't have to be afraid.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
That big, old boat started to sink.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Thought I was a communist.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
You'll do as much for me.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
Our chances really was a million to one.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
Take me as I am or let me go.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
When my working day's through.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
68, but says she's 24.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Mama, you are on my mind.
That's really and truly an American.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
And shot it fulla holes.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
To which a scoundrel clings.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
That I really did try to get close to you.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
And then unto eternity.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
And laid his life on the line.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.

Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.

Look a-the other way.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.

Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
I just can't keep from crying.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Feel further away than ever before.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
I froze right to the bone.
Put me outta doors.
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.

Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
And crime don't have a face.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
A man named Martin Luther King...
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Soft as music, light as spring.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Lay dead beside him there.
With your golden loom.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
So long, honey babe.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
To kill with no pain.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
See him at play makes me smile.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
From my toes up to my ears.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
And time is beginning to crawl.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
But he sure left here in style.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
But I can't get close to her at all.
I'm everybody's brother and son.

I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
I'll remember you.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
In the dark land of the sun.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Where teardrops fall.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.

Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
And rivers that ran through every day.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
For me to return to or chase.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
And make promises by the hours.
And get something quick to eat.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Your voice was all that I heard.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Havanageeluh.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Without ideals or violence.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
He's the neighborhood bully.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
All of your <i>[incomprehensible]</i> and let's talk about your soul.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
I've seen trouble all my days.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
And I want you to be that woman.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
In this concrete world full of souls.
It's just the same as talking to you.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.

As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.

That's the way I remember her best.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
We may not make it through the night.

I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
To the sin of love's false security.
The words that her lover had said.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
They don't make nothing here no more.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
The same as my father before him.
You'd better get that in your head.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
His enemies say he's on their land.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Oh, convey herself away.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom".
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
It don't matter, anyhow.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
You want a watered-down love.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
To hold me in your arms.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
To know which way the wind blows.
Everybody that was hanging out.
While the law looks the other way.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Wants to get it paid off.
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot".
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Where I was born and partly raised.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
Hoping you'll come through too.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
The next day could be your last.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
I just can't see through it anymore.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Four by four they turn it some more.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
You're a big girl now.
What's real and what is not.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.

To anything I might have tried.

And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Well, I saw you making love with him – you forgot to close the garage door.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
People bending broken rules.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

Patriotism, materialism.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.

To make me think I'm wrong.

I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Honey, come and see about me.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Just remember that death is not the end.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
You got a heart of stone.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Got ice water in my veins.

You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Right now I'm having trouble.
And ye shall be a-changed.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
And the people that confronted him were many.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.

Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
Oh, yes, they did.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
That last night I was with.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Chain you down or be your clown.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
By that soft and shining sea.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
If I ride back again.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
She once was a true love of mine.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.

Everybody's having them dreams.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.

Into the land of the midnight sun.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.

But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.

Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.

They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.

Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.

Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.

So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
At the sorority sisters' home.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.

Did so many things I never did intend to do.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
I want you.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Crying out that he been framed.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
He's got his mother's eyes.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Most of the time.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Someone I really could care for.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Who says she knows me well.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
God knows...
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
Fear to bring children into the world.
I don't even know why we come.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
May you stay forever young.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Living down Sonora way.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
You don't have to worry any more.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
When she's better only time'll tell.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
You're gonna need my help someday.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
To be alone with you.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Someone to open each and every door.
Take it on down to give me grow.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
I don't know.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Crying out that he was framed.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Going through all these things twice.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
To live it you had to explode.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
I'm going where I never been before.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
I been in this thing too long.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
His voice was low with pain.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Unless they're from another world.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
That number eleven was closing.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
But simply because it's true.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Who always was too proud to beg.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
I got trouble in my mind.
And I'll go last.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Duality, mortality.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
It's that million dollar bash.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
And you only got ten.
And the mailbox is locked.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Till your error you clearly learn.
On this new morning with you.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
And watch the parking meters.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
My baby took my heart from me.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
The hour when the ship comes in.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
Even the softest touch.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
It always does when you're with me.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
And clouds cover up the ground.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
I'm a poet, I know it.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Or put up against the wall.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And all your raging glory.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Ever since I seen you there.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
If you throw it all away.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
In fond memory appear.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Some speak of the future.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
I'd like to know.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
Go lightly on the ground.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Rain would gather too.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Some place so high above the wall.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
I didn't realize how young you were.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
I'd be lost if not for you.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
'Steada acting like we never met.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
But with the country to where you're going.
With my suitcase in my hand.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
For your times, they are a-changing.
The National Guard stands around his door.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
I shall be released.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
But I was raised on the other.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
I didn't feel so cold then.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
And you must realize the danger.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
That linger in the fireball heat.
Is when I'm alone with you.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
I couldn't find any.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Have fallen from her curls.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
"Don't trill no news on me.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Hope I don't blow it.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Baby, please come home.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
And gives it to me for a song.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
You can show me a new place to start.
I said that.
At the end of the trail.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Can't see over to the other side.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
I hope you're ready.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Girls like birds fly away.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Trying to create a next world war.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
It was a normal day.
Figuring a way to get back home.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
And I's left alone with three children.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
For the times, they are a-changing.
That set everybody free.
I just can't do what I done before.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
And left me here facing the wall.
You break your promise all over the place.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Life don't mean a thing.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
There were six thousand people there.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders. I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Come on, baby...
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Rode slowly back again.
Honey, I want you.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
But you break just like a little girl.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Come on, baby.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.

Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue:
His epitaph plain:
Yeah, serve somebody:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
But there's one promise, darling:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Till I come into New York town:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Make promises by the hour;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Some speak of the future;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Everybody that was hanging out;
I find complete love;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Had to be held down by big police;
All lies and jest;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Crumble into one another;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?"

<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Are you ready?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Baby, what more can I tell?
What would life be?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Does anyone even try?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
How can I live for You?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Where did you lose your wings?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Have they missed you?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
How's everything in heaven?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
I seen better times, but who has not?
How many more without any reward?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Am I ready?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
How does it feel?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Before it's washed to the sea?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Can you get back in?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
What do you think about that, my friend?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
By golly, what more can I say?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
And how does it feel?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Must everybody bow?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Just like a rolling stone?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
When did you leave heaven?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
For all these earthly things?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
How could they let you go?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Does he change the course of rivers?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
What good am I?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
How many more can they afford?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
But, something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
When he's standing in front of you?
Baby, can't you tell?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Before he can see the sky?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Just what in the world has come over you?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Has anybody seen my love?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Why would I want to take your life?
Am I still dreaming yet?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Across the swooping plain?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
How could they ever mistake you?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Gal, where you been so long?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
That too many people have died?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Before you call him a man?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
How much poison did they inhale?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Can I come home with you?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Across the swamp of time?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
What can I give to You?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
To love and follow His direction?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
How many compared to yesterday?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Too many people have died?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Before he can hear people cry?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Of everything you see?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
How long are we gonna be riding?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
What can I do for You?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Why must you always try to make me over?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Before they're forever banned?
Oh, so why not you and me?
What else can a poor boy do?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Like a rolling stone?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
How come you don't send me no regards?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
And one deserving of affection?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Where did you hide your halo?
Why and what's the reason for?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Who killed Davey Moore?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
How can you say he will haunt you?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
It was put together down in Argentina
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
He was a clean-cut kid
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
For what you sold that's not been received
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
They took a clean-cut kid
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
All the sweethearts you can hold
I thought that it was well-understood
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
So I'll make my stand
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
We live in a political world
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Silvio, silver and gold
I'll always thank the Lord
Now, whenever I get up and
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
He wagged his tail and shook his head
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Nothing was delivered
As I stand upon the sand
You try so hard, but you don't understand
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Now you don't act so––so proud
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
By no special friend
Many times I've often prayed
Then came the warning that was before the flood
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Standing on the water, casting your bread
And into the path you are hurled
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Either from the mountains of Madrid
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And those whom doom and death had spared
It's something you did
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Somebody seen him hanging around
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
The changes I was going through can't even be used
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
"Equality". I spoke the word
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
I want you, baby, just to understand
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Just what you had in mind
But now something has changed
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
And things would be different the next time we wed
There ain't nothing in this world
I will not go down under the ground
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Now, a very great man once said
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
I had to say something to strike him very weird
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
I run right home and I went to bed
You used to be so amused
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
I live in another world
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Now you don't seem so proud
How many times can a man turn his head
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
And your trouble is you know it too good
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Things would be different the next time we wed
While some, on principles baptized
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Maybe someday you will understand
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
She let go of my hand
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
To see him obviously framed
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And then you told me later as I apologized
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
But she ain't gonna find the road
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
You used––be so proud
Its iron claws attached
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
I've been walking around
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
So I look like a walking mountain range
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
I am homeless, come and take me
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
From all the plans they do pursue
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
But I can't say I sympathize
Most of the time I can't even be sure
And I'm just the same as anyone else
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And suddenly there appeared before me
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Though its shadow's metal badge
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
"It's only you that he does crave
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Better stay away from those
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
You say you're looking for someone
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
At dawn my lover comes to me
All I feel is heat and flame
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
I'm sure you're the one to blame
When the rain is blowing in your face
They say don't come back no more
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
And the Negro's name
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
You said you'd never compromise
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
So, I called up the operator of time
I don't even notice she gone
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
As he rises to fame
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Hunger pays a heavy price
Should I put them by your gate
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
To give the special one you seek a chance
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
She been gone
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Breaking hearts up and down the line
But it won't be over till they clear his name
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And that is that one must always flush out his house
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
When the roses fade
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
He'll see by his grave
And I ain't complaining none
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Taking care of somebody nice
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
"Oh, father, you will surely die
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
And I would send a message
Should I leave them by your gate
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
So up she picked her babies three
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
On the rising curve
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Everybody's wearing a disguise
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
To show you something you seen before
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
But I can get another one
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
What's probably got you baffled more
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
I do declare
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
You into thinking you're the one
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
The man the authorities came to blame
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
There were times when I was so lonesome
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
We see this empty cage now corrode
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
So I remember every face
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
I can survive and I can endure
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
From the start by the rule
You cut to the core
And plenty time for good romance
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
If dogs run free, why not we
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Mona tried to tell me
And her silver-studded phantom cause
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
If dogs run free, why not me
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
And you see why it's so unique to be
Waiting to find out what price
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
But I feel nothing for their game
Looking at hands for the lines that were
A bed that is never mine
Limited in sex they dare
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
She plunged him into well water where
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Just pick anyone
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
The crashing waves roll over me
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
I rode with him in a taxi once
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Little did I realize
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Well, six white horses that you did promise
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Just what you will say when you get home
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Lies that life is black-and-white
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
A girl who would murder her own, true love
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
You just pick anyone
Knows there's no success like failure
You know, it's not even safe no more
I been wondering all about me
It's all new to me
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Remember me to one who lives there
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Says it's closing time
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
You could almost think that you're seeing double
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
What about that millionaire
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Full of hope and desire
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
How many ears must one man have
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Among the lovely people living free
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
But the dark does die
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Leaving men wholly, totally free
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
While them that defend what they cannot see
What good am I then to others and me
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
And never sat once at the head of the table
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Up into some paradise
Why wait any longer for the one you love
If dogs run free, then what must be
She knows there's no success like failure
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Remember me to the one who lives there
"That I might be gone a long, old time
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
You're not free to belong to me
How was I to know you'd be the one
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
When I'm all alone
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
The cause was there before we came
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Where I could watch her waltz for free
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
When Reilly's daughter got a message
That she's the same one
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
It'll be with me unto the grave
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Oh, trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
What am I saying? What am I knowing
I can hear their hearts a-beating
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Deceived me into thinking
You left me standing in the doorway crying
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
The order is rapidly fading
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
They're drinking up and walking
The battle outside raging
'Cause the battle outside raging
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Where the time and the tempo drag
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
She rode by night and came by morning
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
If I was with her too long
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
It's not a bad way to make a living
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Early in the morning, early in the morning
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
But then a whistle will be blowing
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
For your weary toes to be touching
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
There's nothing in here moving
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
And there's no telling who that it's naming
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
The order is a-rapidly fading
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Then she told us how times were tough
I have fallen far beneath
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
And how I know I'll make it through
You go north and you go south
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Look out, the saints are coming through
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
You turn around to take a final peek
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
But they caught him and they brought him back
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
The man in me will do nearly any task
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Her voice once and talk
Make everything from toy guns that spark
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
I wish she'd unlock
Shoot in the back
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Well, there ain't no going back
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
How does it feel
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
He's taught in his school
He's sure got a lot of gall
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
A-how does it feel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Ring bar, hard to tell
Then why don't she tell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Oh, how does it feel
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
I chased me a woman up the hill
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
As the last fire-truck from hell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
And if my love is real
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
All and all can only fall
A girl by the whirlpool
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
To make all that should be killed to crawl
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
How many seas must a white dove sail
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
They ask me how I feel
Ring bell, hard to tell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
How many seas must the white dove sail
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Muttering small talk at the wall
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
And remain as I am
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
But I can hear another drum
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
You better not chew gum
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
"For you cannot relive them
Two eyes took the aim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Their religion of the little ten women
And all their daughters put me down
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
But me, I expected it to happen
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
I'll be waiting at the station
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
But the second mom was with the seventh son
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Well, I'm hanging on
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
You don't need a weatherman
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
To remember the times when I was your only man
The next morning she had awoken
To my knowledge there's just one man
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
She takes just like a woman
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
I don't even care if I ever see her again
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
But it's hard to think on
But all their daughters put me down
How can the life of such a man
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Trying to get a lead on
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And there's no exit in any direction
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Guns and clubs followed him down
And she aches just like a woman
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Yes, and someone must explain
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
But I swear I see my reflection
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
"Not me," said the gambling man
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Why did you trade heaven
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
All lay down their bandanas and complain
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
A-she takes just like a woman
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
She got such a sweet disposition
He got that fortress on the mountain
And she wakes just like a woman
She said that all the railroad men
The ones that jump on the wagon
Uncle Rat went running downtown
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
In the pigpen
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
All their daughters put me down
My love, she's like some raven
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Well, you fake just like a woman
In ceremonies of the horsemen
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
As they rode him in custody down to the station
From heights that they could not gain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
How many roads must a man walk down
And the smell of their roses does not remain
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Darkness at the break of noon
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
And you ache a-just like a woman
You take just like a woman
That long, black train is pulling down
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Out of the shower comes a football man
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
For the loser now might be later to win
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
But the post office has been stolen
For the loser now will be later to win
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Have died in battle or in vain
Advertising signs that con
As you sit on the box you keep him in
That long, black train is pulling on down
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
I figure maybe we're even
And the corner sign
Somebody new to beat on
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Will not be understood as they're spoken
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Must meet the dawn
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Suicide remarks are torn
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
You need something to make it known
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Silvio, I gotta go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Every place I wanna go
There's nothing you can say or do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
All I really wanna do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
There is a place you go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
All I'd like you to do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
I walked down there and ended up
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Aladdin and his lamp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Man in the coon-skin cap
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
What good am I while you softly weep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
How many times must a man look up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
When you whispered in my ear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
I could feel a whole lot better
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
In one I was running and in another
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
The lover who has just walked out your door
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
Who came here from Cuba's door
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
For all eternity I think I will remember
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
The face of God will appear
Still I've always kind of missed her
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
For I am married to a house carpenter
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
I close my eyes and I wonder
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
All you boys better run for cover
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
I say, "Why you say that for
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
The wind howls like a hammer
So, don't fear if you hear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
She took him by his long, yellow hair
Never no more do I wonder
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
At any moment you could go under
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When only you are near
But morning is clear
You heard me saying a prayer for
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I don't have to go far
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
And I don't even think about her
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Still I say her love-words over
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Thinking of a series of dreams
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
With a big bouquet of the roses
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
You been hurt so many times
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And, though the masters make the rules
You know that he has no intentions
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Six-time losers
When your mother sends back all your invitations
But still remains
I try to tell it like it is
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
As friends and other strangers
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
They whisper in the wings
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
You can fall down on your knees
He's not selling any alibis
The empty-handed painter from your streets
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
The cowboy angel rides
Now, you must provide some answers
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the princess and the prince discuss
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
I'm gonna let you pass
Romantic facts of musketeers
To sharpen the senses
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Don't follow leaders
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
That it's you and no one else that owns
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
People on the platforms
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And I try to harmonize with songs
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
You should be made to wear earphones
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Seven days
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Six-time users
And the poor white remains
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
We living in times when men commit crimes
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Mama, you know, awaits the news
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I'd gladly confess
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To the cutting of fences
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
You never turned around to see the frowns
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
On the back of the fish truck that loads
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
How many deaths will it take till he knows
What good am I if I say foolish things
Glide across the lonely years
Girl by the whirlpool's
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And then complains
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
"Not me," said the man whose fists
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Well, the ragman draws circles
And so Patty calls the cops
True love can make a blade of grass
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And tells me of her dreams
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Wants eleven dollar bills
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Her window's wide open, African trees
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
But, though the masters make the rules
To memorizing politics
Don't wear sandals
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
And your father, to your sister he explains
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Statues made of matchsticks
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
People carry roses
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
At times I think there are no words
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Good and bad, I define these terms
Talking that the heat put
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
And the first one now will later be last
Without any doubt
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
You used to laugh about
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
I soon get some rest
In the precious winds they rot
That might be all that you got
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Our Father would not like the way that you act
I'm on the pavement
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
You don't forget
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
You used to laugh–make fun about
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Johnny's in the basement
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
No one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Everyone still talks about
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Everything is always right
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
To hold each other tight
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
The slow one now will later be fast
Oh, everybody's got to eat
One more night I will wait for the light
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
By the way, that's a cute hat
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
How many years can some people exist
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
They tell me revenge is sweet
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I got into the driver's seat
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
To keep it in your mind and not forget
There's some people that
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
You are there in the flickering light
Wait for the morning light
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
He built a fire on Main Street
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
But, if the arrow is straight
So he never thinks straight
Keep me set apart
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
And no one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Keep it in your mind and not forget
It don't take too long to find out
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Yet you know there is no answer fit
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
You're gonna get hit
One more night the moon is shining bright
And I, in my armor, turning about
He really wasn't where it's at
They tell me to be discreet
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Well, early in the morning till late at night
She seems too far out
Plants in the bed, but
With your pockets well protected at last
You're hearing my heart beat
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
How many years can a mountain exist
In the stillness of the midnight
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
I think that it's best
The slowest now will later be fast
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
And, since my feet are now fast
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
I just might have to come see you
I'll remember you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To protect you and defend you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And I tell this truth to you
It's just crazy being here with you
I can be just like you
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To be alone with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Don't it always go to show
Sooner or later one of us must know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
With only you in view
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
It only goes to show
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Don't it always a-go to show
Well, I'd sure like to know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
I'd sure like to know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
But sooner or later one of us must know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
He been living there three years now
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
The only one I know
For them that think death––death's honesty
The same thing I would want today
Or if you just want some company
No, you'll not now or no other day
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
For them that think death's honesty
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
But I can't deny
So they took him to the infirmary
So I run down most hurriedly
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
She knocked upon it anyway
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Is worth more than I could pay
So, I'm walking down your highway
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
That I was just a puppet in a play
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though I'd never say
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And I'm leaving every day to run away
But I wish there was something you would do or say
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
She smiles, walks the other way
And for His love they took His life away
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
My ears hear a symphony
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
We banged the drum slowly
He made the bells of freedom ring today
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Maggie says that many say
A cock is crowing far away
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
To those condemned to act accordingly
The Spanish-American War had its day
And the only tune my guitar could play
Went to the doctor the very next day
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
And it's up to you to say
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Spouted out that liberty
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
My mind weaves a symphony
Someone to get you flowers constantly
But you can never steal away
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
I send you all my money
From phony jealousy
I did not do it harmfully
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
And that which you've given me today
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
That I done it the way
If I don't take the chance to try
And the ladies treat me kindly
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Don't you tell Henry
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
For them that must obey authority
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Well, I saw it advertised one day
How many times must the cannon balls fly
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Well, I'm walking down the highway
She puts it to me plain as day
Ten thousand miles or more –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Havana–gee–
Hava–na–
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I'm sure it was not three –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
You will not hear a laugh –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
There oughtta be a law against you coming around –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I a-hope you can hear––
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Indians camp along her border –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
It's just a ragged clown behind –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
You should be made to be wearing a telephone –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
How badly they were shocked –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Ha–va–
That can win what's a-never been won –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Private reasons – great or small –
Whispering your secret emotion –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Leave all the children home –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Turn, turn, turn again –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Havanagee–luh–
With no other choice except but for to go –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Hang out the whole next day –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
What you're gonna say when you get home –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
I got no idea what I want –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
First degree and second degree –
I hope that you can hear––
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
I long to hold you in the night –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Oh, my–
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Disconnect these cables––
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
To know where you are –
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
