They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."

And keep him good company."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Country'll grow."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."

Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
I love far better than thee."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
So write to her tenderly."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
I'll apply them all to thee."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"

Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I didn't see you around."

None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
You and I'll never know."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Will mourn for your return."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Come flowing down so free?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
I can't find my knees."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
You can't blame me at all."
But I know what you want."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And hung on a willow tree."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
I'll endow them onto thee."
"I've had too much of your company,"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
We'll both go home together."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
We want folksingers here."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
I'll see her soon, I know."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
I'll bring back my lady."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Tangled up in blue."
But we were tangled up in blue."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And have it on Highway 61."
He said, "Tell me about it."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
That you must always first forgive them."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Where you and I will unite."
Get on your horse and ride away."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
You can't blame us at all."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Have it on Highway 61."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
I would want again tomorrow."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
And ye shall be a-changed,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
In the hills of mystery,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
When she lays upon the grass,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
It always has hit me from below,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
I wish tonight were here,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
If you throw it all away,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Memory, ecstasy,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Watered-down love,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
May be living in another country under another name,
My hands can't feel to grip,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
You made it there somehow,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Try hard, get barred,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Or have done something wrong,
Silhouetted by the sea,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
But, if I can save you any time,
Day you quit me, baby,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Someone to open each and every door,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
I thank the Lord,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
I just can't beg you anymore,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Broken threads, broken springs,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
But, if I will save you the time,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
They took a clean-cut kid,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
I'd be sad and blue,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Don't let me change my heart,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Or select you or dissect you,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Broken switches, broken gates,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
You're beautiful beyond words,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Keep a clean nose,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Ye shall be changed,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Don't steal, don't lift,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
So unknown,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I'm leaving today,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
The winter would hold no spring,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
It always means so much,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
You got something better,
Go melt back in the night,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
New morning,
Of ancient history,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Yet every distance is not near,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
A man with a badge skips by,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Front door shut, back door too,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
With the juice running down my leg,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Dream about you, baby,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
And I'm back in the rain,
I can make it through,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Well, come all without, come all within,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
And furnish me with tape,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Judge and jury took their stand,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
God don't call it treason,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
When I seen him lose control,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I had so much left to do,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Oxford Town around the bend,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Private reasons, great or small,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
We'll go someplace unknown,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
God knows there's a purpose,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
And gathering storms may arise,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
You can hear them tires squeal,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Too serious to fool,
I got no place left to turn,
In the little church a-this side of town,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
This situation can only get rougher,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Seem like I been down this way before,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Father of night, father of day,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Looking 'bout the government,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Need a woman all the time,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
I once held her in my arms,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
They say everything can be replaced,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
If you'd see me this way,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Can't find what I need,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Eh, see what you can do,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Without a dream in my heart,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Maybe when we both get sober,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
God knows it's a crime,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Oh, see what you can do,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
She never does me wrong,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Drifting too far from shore,
For the politician's gain,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Eh, in somebody's room,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Don't try No Doz,
Hang around the ink-well,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
The man in the trench-coat,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Nothing too very scientific,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
The sky too is folding over you,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Alright, I'm so glad,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Heart of mine,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I'm gonna let you pass,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
In love and with kindness,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
People talk over situations,
One summer's day he came passing by,
I got a wife and five little children,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
All I really wanna do,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Yesterday's just a memory,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
But something has changed,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Loyalty, unity,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
You say my kisses are not like his,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
It's really something,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Like you never did before,
As his youth now unfolds,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
I won't have my nature way,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Far away in the stormy night,
How he died nobody could say,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
High water rising, rising night and day,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
He is centuries old,
A question in your nerves is lit,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
A thousand miles from home,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
How does it feel,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Baby, please stop crying,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Don't let her hear,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I went down where the vultures feed,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Wasn't making any great connection,
He's not selling any alibis,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
And the point is slick,
The train leaves at half past ten,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
My dear, sweet friend,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
But I'm pressing on,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
But he can't be blamed,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
But, if you want me to,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Watching the river flow,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Watch the river flow,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Corrina, Corrina,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
I think we better talk this over,
I tried to reach you, honey,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
All the tired horses in the sun,
So, never leave me lonely,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
China doll, alcohol,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
I'm never, never far from home,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
In the great unknown,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Give you my money, honey,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
It was you who came right through,
Got my mind made up,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
On the stone that remains,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
With a killer's pride, security,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
I march in the parade of liberty,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
I went into the red, went into the black,
I'd only have to stay,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
You want watered-down love,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Poor boy never say die,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Stripping away at it all,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Carved next to his name,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
May be an actor in a plot,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
She leave by the other and roam,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
We've killed each one,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
They don't believe in mercy,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
And pretend that we never have touched,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
No direction home,
Aim well, my little one,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
They keep it all hid,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Tell me,
I don't wanna fake you out,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
To gather flowers constantly,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Broken lines, broken strings,
They must bust in early May,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
And it's like I ain't here,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
My arms and legs were broken,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Bring the wife and family,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
And also by his feet,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Said I'm pressing on,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
You and me, we had completeness,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
The carpet too is moving under you,
And give him back the time he's done,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
That the laws are with him,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
If not for you,
I ain't looking to block you up,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
And, though the line is cut,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
And not going through any great extreme,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Madams light the candles,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
The man there said he loved my sound,
And she'll be coming forth,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
You to me were true,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
See her in that very tight skirt,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
God knows it's terrifying,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Wintertime in New York town,
I've been in and out of happiness,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Every moon is so sanctified,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
You better duck down the alleyway,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
And may you stay forever young,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Come all without, come all within,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
One by one until there were none,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
You have given me life to live,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Don't you tell Henry,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
The night would see me wide awake,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Father of black, father of white,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Just like I did before,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
I'm going out of my mind,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
How many times have you heard someone say,
When I was in Missouri,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
You had enough of hatred,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
I fell down to my bended knees,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
"Not I," said the referee,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
When there is no more,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
I just say no thanks,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
How many a year has passed and gone,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
They pass by so silently,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Look away, you rolling river,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
If you'd see me this a-way,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
In the lonely night,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Well, I may just swear,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
I know I can't win,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
They say that every man must fall,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
He been around the world and back again,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Vanished from my hand,
King of the streets, child of clay,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
I wish I a-was a magician,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Under the microscope,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
A hand set the spark,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
I've been all around the world, boys,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Winter would have no spring,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Of this I can't say very much,
Trust yourself,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Where the neon madmen climb,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
But I know that he don't talk,
Well, the way I love that woman,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
I long to see you in the morning light,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
I don't want to meet your kin,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
You were striped, you were plain,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Stand up straight and tall,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Some things are too hot to touch,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
And I got the worried blues,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Don't wanna be a bum,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
I try my best to be just like I am,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
I can't understand,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Where life and death are memorized,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
You're beautiful to me,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Don't wear sandals,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Cares not to come up any higher,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Broken idols, broken heads,
And you take just like a woman,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
And I don't want to drag you down,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
That fired the gun,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
First degree and second degree,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
And it ain't me, babe,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
If she ain't feeling well,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
To be so useless and all,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Look who's back in town,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Now you don't talk so loud,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Into my own parade,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
That fellow who never blushes,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Look out, kid,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Ain't no going back,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
I went into the city, into the town,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Who will promise never to part,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Heart of mine, be still,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
The day would surely have to break,
Six months on the chain gang,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
And come every time you call,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Stay away from the train line,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
God knows you ain't pretty,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Ever since I been a child,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Like a dog on a chain,
If anything is gonna sell,
They lowered him down as a king,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Went back home to the yard,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
As I travel down life's pathway,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Yes, I want you so bad,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
To be without a home,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
The only son of God Almighty,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
The path you've endured has been rough,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Going, going, gone,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Father of air and father of trees,
And there's two white horses following me,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
To shine in through,
You can run down to the desert,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Make you spin or do you in,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
And I'm just like that bird,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
And it still ain't me, babe,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Serve somebody,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Better jump down the manhole,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
In the image of someone you used to know,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
You got to serve somebody,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
To be one your own,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Using every angle under the sun,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
See you fly or watch you die,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Precious angel under the sun,
Where I will always be renewed,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
People going down to the ground,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
I'll be on my way,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
They say every man needs protection,
Automobile coming into style,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
In the end,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
You find God in the church of your choice,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Human gods aim for their mark,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Want you so bad,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
I swung on to my old guitar,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Ah, get sick, get well,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Grandpa died last week,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
It's a price I have to pay,
I'm going back to Colorado,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
If'n you don't know by now,
To have––be on your own,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
And, if I can save you any time,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
God knows it's true,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
For she ain't the same,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
It was from her ship sailing,
As the daylight hours do increase,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
You don't have to feed me,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
You were snow, you were rain,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Oh, Angelina,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
To be alone with you,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Every nerve is analyzed,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
That long, black train is pulling down,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
That her father was going to hang,
Most of the time it's well understood,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
You got something I want plenty of,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
It hurts me, too,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
They say every man must fall,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Advertising signs, they con,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Just then the order came to charge,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
She's opened up a happy home,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
In his anger and his shame,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Like some mystery,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,

Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,

But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,

They're throwing knives into the tree,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
While riding on a train going west,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
The angels play on their horns all day,

Every brain is civilized,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Staying far behind without you,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,

Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
In the darkness of my night,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,

And he just smoked my eyelids,
Precious father, loving mother,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,

That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
I'd give you the sky high above,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
And, if I see the day,
Where mercy walks the plank,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
My love, she speaks softly,
I landed up on the downtown side,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
With his fist in a clinch,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
You gotta look some other place,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
One by one they follow the sun,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Honey, I will meet you there,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Searching everywhere I know,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
You'll change your last name, too,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
To your tambourine in time,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
This place ain't doing me any good,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
I need a shot of love,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Strike another match, go start anew,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
The night passed away so quickly,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,

Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
By rivers of blindness,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Go down to the river, babe,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
How he died nobody can say,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Three angels up above the street,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
I can't be good, baby,
Come on, come on, stick together,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
This world is ruled by violence,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
She said she would never forget,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
And, although that we're single and free,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,

What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
He won't do nothing to you,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Better jump down a manhole,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
I can change, I swear,
Don't let me drift too far,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
God sees it all unfold,

I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Don't let yourself fall,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
By users, cheaters,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Since you've been gone,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Up and down the block,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
The day you quit me, baby,
I want my arms around you,
To a solid rock,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
I got the worried blues,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Looking for a new fool,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
That must be what it's all about,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
But you were gambling for support,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
The sky too is folding under you,
Nothing was delivered,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
From their fates try to resign,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
And I'm so glad,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Don't ever try to change me,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
To strict party-platform ties,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
In the turning of twilight,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
One by one they followed the sun,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
To stay closer than any friend,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Is looking for a new fool,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
They run a brick and tile company,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
I been riding the midnight train,
Mixing up the medicine,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Mercury, gravity,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
My woman needs it every day,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Resent him to the bone,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
I should have left this town this morning,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
You could look at it and weep,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
By losers, cheaters,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
She'll surely turn to white,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Like as not, it's better so,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
If ever I prove false to you,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Not the end, not the end,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
My hands didn't touch him none,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Don't follow leaders,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
You have given all there is to give,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
As the present now will later be past,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
And I'm in the shade,
She got great big hind legs,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
I'm going down the river,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Love that's pure no accident,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
She'll be coming forth,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
They walk among the stately trees,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Well, get sick, get well,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
The wind howls like a hammer,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
The joint is jumping,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
With no direction home,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
And I got those worried blues,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Eh, singing just for you,
God knows how to make it flow,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
You have explained every mystery,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I try my best to be like I am,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Badge out, laid off,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
The beat is pumping,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
I just can't do what I've done before,
With what your fate is going to be,
I rambled out of New York town,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
It's like I ain't here,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Why she did go,
She would have married me,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Who could they get to carry you,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
I'd already gone the distance,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
And point away from the past,
People carry roses,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Gonna serve somebody,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
And the whole world is on your case,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Don't let her see that you need her,
You broke a heart that loved you,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Got me a secret membership card,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
You can raise up your right hand,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
I have no one to meet,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
And to come every time you call,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Two by two they step in the dark,
And she makes love just like a woman,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Without your sweet love,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Rabbit running down across the road,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Want you,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
In the instant that I preach,
Over your senses you have no control,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Just like a rolling stone,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Had no one to go my bail,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
The Second World War came to an end,
Is used, it is plain,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
And forget my pride,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Carry the New York Times,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Roll, Willie, roll,
You have given everything to me,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Pick you up every time you fall,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
So I got those worries blues,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
I would not feel so all alone,
That foreign sound in your ear,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
She said she would always stay,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Get back, write Braille,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Thieving in the alley,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Like a rolling stone,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Every head is so dignified,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
I like the cool way you look at me,
My limbs are shaking,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
God don't call it wrong,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
All the silver, all the gold,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
I shall be released,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
While paupers change possessions,
It's too bad he had to go,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
To be on your own,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
I've been around this whole country,
You can stick your head in the sand,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
You have laid down Your life for me,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Strangers all give me the news,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Adiós, mi corazón,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Circled by the circus sands,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
And, if anybody asks me,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
But it would not be new,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Over the hills and far away,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Puffing on a big cigar,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
The air is getting hotter,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Tell her not to worry,
No, nothing was delivered,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
You have given me eyes to see,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
They say every distance is not near,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Went to the station down in the yard,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Read books, repeat quotations,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
I been good,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
It don't matter what you did,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
But, deep inside my heart,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
I can finish this alone, honey,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
A handle hid out in the dark,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
For his age he is wise,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Get dressed, get blessed,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Far away from it all,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
And comes to a permanent stop,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
My senses have been stripped,
Oh, in somebody's room,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
In a pine box for all eternity,
God knows everything,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Too noble to neglect,
And you make love just like a woman,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
At the close of the day,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Don't let her see,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Without ideals or violence,
Go away from my window,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Love don't have any place,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
You married young just like your ma,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Icicles hanging down,
Stone you and say good luck,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Hazel, you called and I came,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
It's alright,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Never did feel this way before,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
She once was a true love of mine,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
I want you so bad,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
But ye shall be a-changed,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
They say every man need protection,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Tell me that you love me only,
I never can go because, you know,
You will be alright, girl,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
I went down to scrub and rub,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Someone to close his heart,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
I got a bird that whistles,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
If you must cling to someone,
Till both of us fell by the way,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
But you're doing it again,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
But I've been hanging on,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Just as long as you stay with me,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
"Not me," said his manager,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Don't matter what you did,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
We live in a political world,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
I got two white horses following me,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Heart of mine, go back home,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
You've got to serve somebody,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
I'm so glad,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
You wanna drown love,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
And your streets are getting empty,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
God knows there's a river,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
For something that he never done,
God knows it's fragile,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
May you stay forever young,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Without a love of my own,
You stole her love from me one day,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
You even make love just like a woman,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
And the sooner you come up with them,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
God knows it's outta sight,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
God knows there's a heaven,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
To be––direction home,
That can do what's a-never been done,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Try to be a success,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Out to the windy beach,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
But I'm saved,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Don't let her know,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
God knows that, when you see it,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
When the night comes falling,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
I went back home, put on my tie,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Just don't know what to do,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
That you'd have liked me to,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Searching high, searching low,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Thank You, Lord,
Analyze you, categorize you,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
A dream about you, baby,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
And rivers that ran through every day,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Light yourself a candle,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
To protect his white skin,
All them prophets good and gone,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Newspapermen eating candy,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
We'll fly the night away,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
The country music station plays soft,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
That one doctor cannot save him,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
There's always someone who understands,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Well, I been gambling so long,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
And she aches just like a woman,
He's young and on fire,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Living in the land of Nod,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Laying low,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
A million faces at my feet,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
If I didn't have to guess,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
The country doctor rambles,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
And it's only that I'm asking,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
My love, she speaks like silence,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Oh, watered-down love,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Pressing on,
Far away and over the wall,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Oh, singing just for you,
Face full of black soot,
For the wise men and the fools,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
I bless the day I found you,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
God knows it's a struggle,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Hold me, baby, be near,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
There she come, now, down my way,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Relationships of ownership,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
But, to remain as friends,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Now, won't you tell me true,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Giving back all of what you owe,
And every cause that ever I fought,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Well, well, well,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
But the bottles are done,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
They tell me every man must fall,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
The one we can see and can feel,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
And here I sit so patiently,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Seven days,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Going home,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
I got my mind made up,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
To hang and to lynch,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Well, I can't understand,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
For her to arrive,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
So glad,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Father of day, father of night,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Well, I'm so glad,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
But you try with your whole soul,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
I just keep pressing on,
God knows there's a chance,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
All you can do is do what you must,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Get born, keep warm,
I went out last night to take a little round,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Forever young, forever young,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Speaking to some French girl,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
But it ain't him to blame,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
And I––I walk out on my own,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Never weak, but always strong,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
That can do what's never been done,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Don't know what to do without it,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
True love of mine,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
To keep up his hate,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
I just don't know what to do,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
It's rising up above my head,
Father of loneliness and pain,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
On this new morning, new morning,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
It's not aimed at anyone,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
True love, they've been without it,
Baby, let me follow you down,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
And think they're fooling you,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Saved,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
A complete unknown,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Yesterday is just a memory,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
God knows you've got to weep,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
They say every man must need protection,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
I've been saved – well, alright,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
And on the highway of regret,
The light I never knowed,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
All that and more and then some,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Each time we meet, love,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
And played the fife lowly,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
For all intended purposes,
Father of minutes, father of days,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
I been good while I been waiting,
In the shadows of moonlight,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
You need something to open up a new door,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
The kingdoms of experience,
Just remember that death is not the end,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Makes no difference where she's been,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
But now morning is clear,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Read books and repeat quotations,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Is it really any wonder,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
I don't care if you analyze me,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
God knows when,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Equality, liberty,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Waiting for the trains,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
A man named Martin Luther King,
But evidently she don't,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
I want you,
To be out on your own,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
He's the property of Jesus,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Don't let her know that you love her,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
But the time ain't tall,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Just to know that you are near,
First to come in was the flying moth,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
You need something to open your eyes,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
To find out if she's talked,
Honey, just for you to climb,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
In another I witnessed a crime,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Like a complete unknown,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
That four ears cannot hear him,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Dust on my face and my cape,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
To know how much I really care,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
A true love of mine,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Don't tie no bows,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
But it ain't me, babe,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I went into the city, went into the town,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
That's where you belong --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Democracy don't rule the world --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
I see better days and I do better things.
It's that million dollar bash.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
I'm just average, common too.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
The whole night through.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
I got nothing left to burn.
Never will want for money.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
In my Cadillac.
Last radio is playing.
That big, old boat started to sink.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
My love, she speaks softly.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
I only saw what they let me see.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
It sure is right on a night like this.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
I think this time we should escape.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
The light I never knowed.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
The next day could be your last.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Join the army if you fail.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
You got it, baby.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
Under the midnight moon.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Girls like birds fly away.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
I can't shoot them anymore.
That must be what it's all about.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Means another poor boy is underground.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
And your highway's getting filled.
You're a big girl all the way.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
You'll do as much for me.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
That's the day you die.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
While I'm in the hall.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
It was you who understood.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
Tell me.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
That can win what's never been won.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
I always thought that he was well.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Oh, convey herself away.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
Of every man who put me here.
Evidently she won't.
We may not make it through the night.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Nobility, humility.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
The hour that the ship comes in.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Wasn't any difference to me.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
I shall be released.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
And the night blows rainy.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
May you stay forever young.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Someone I really could care for.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
I'll hold it down for you.
Wants to get it paid off.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
Headed out for the western skies.
I long to reach for you in the night.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
He's always on trial for just being born.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
Everything is gonna be alright.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Someone to open each and every door.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Come on, honey.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Like you never done before.
I can't fire them anymore.
Everybody that was hanging out.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
With the glory that is to be.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Until my dying-day.
They got – all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
And laid his life on the line.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
That's the way I remember her best.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Honey, I never would have come.
'Cause I don't think about it.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
The hour when the ship comes in.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
I've seen trouble all my days.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Honey, come and see about me.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Far down the street we stray.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
But it was more than I could do.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I can't see through it anymore.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Come on, baby...
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Baby, two feet from the well.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
Slowly into autumn.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
And she had left him to die in there.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
In the pale moonlight.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
You're my baby.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
The sooner you can leave.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Now they say it's the land of money.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
You break your promise all over the place.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
Without this love that we call ours.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
I been worrying about you, baby.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Hmm.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
I took some comfort there.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
The night will soon be gone.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
An innocent man in a living hell.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
You always got more than enough rope.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
To the sin of love's false security.
It runs both cold and deep.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
It only brings me sorrow.
Bring that bottle over here.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
So quickly into autumn.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
You have no idea what you do to me.
The same as my father before him.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
When I paint my masterpiece.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
Blowing through another no-good town.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
I'm going where I never been before.
Rode slowly back again.
Got my mind made up.
It would go up against every rule.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Come on, darling.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Look a-the other way.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
I want everybody to be free.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Life don't mean a thing.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Greenwich Village.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
My baby took my heart from me.
And discovered her invisible self.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
I hope you're ready.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
I'd give anything to be with you.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
It hurts me, too.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
I hope I'm ready.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
I can't fight them anymore.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
You know, I loved her just the same.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
But mine was a little different, you see.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Must be and that is all.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
You sound like a hillbilly.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.

For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
She can't find him anywhere.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Just like you've always smiled before.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
I just can't see through it anymore.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Until I threw it all away.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
By that soft and shining sea.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
No kindred or relative nigh.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Four by four they turn it some more.
I know you always say that you agree.
She said she would always stay.
Step lightly on the ground.
Good car to drive, after a war.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
And gives it to me for a song.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
My love winks, she does not bother.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
They want me for a gambling fight.
Without a love of my own.
With my suitcase in my hand.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Kisses she gave him three.
Humility, simplicity.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
She acts like we never met.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
And come away with me.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
See that my grave is kept clean.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
That brave and devoted band.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Have fallen from her curls.
Some place so high above this wall.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
The sooner you can go.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
When you go your way and I go mine.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
Because everybody must get stoned.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
Lord, protect my child.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
I's looking around just to see myself.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
With your golden loom.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
The place that I started from.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
He's got his mother's eyes.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
And that failure's no success at all.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
All because his face was brown.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
On this new morning with you.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Tried to create a next world war.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Drink up your blood like wine.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
Heart of mine.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Blood on your saddle.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
I needed somebody to talk to.
When I run outta things to investigate.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
I stood wondering which way to go.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
There's a guy I gotta see.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
But he sure left here in style.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
They would not let me be.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
We were the wrong side.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Mortality, reality.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
And clouds cover up the ground.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
You were always so close and still within reach.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
And get something quick to eat.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
It was a normal day.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
And keep away from pranks.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
I can't use it anymore.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Hope you're ready.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
And it is time for me to slide.
Honey, baby.
And make promises by the hours.
Everything is broken.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
To keep her from the howling winds.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
But you're back where you belong.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
With all these promises you left for me.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
You can say I didn't give to you.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
You want a watered-down love.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
You'd better get that in your head.
Even the softest touch.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
The words that her lover had said.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
That which is not permanent don't last.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Ever since I seen her smile.
And ye shall be changed.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
I once held her in my arms.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
And rivers that ran through every day.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
When she's better only time'll tell.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
After losing every battle.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
Walking around with no one else.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
I just can't beg you anymore.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
They don't make nothing here no more.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
He's only a pawn in their game.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
The National Guard stands around the door.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
And you must realize the danger.
To know which way the wind blows.
I got a bird that sings.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
His voice was low with pain.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Under the hedges.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Dollar a day's worth.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Some place so high above the wall.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
When I'm alone with you.
Feel further away than ever before.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
I'll only let you down.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
Down along my restless palms.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
Neighborhood bully.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
I scarcely feel the glow.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
In an oil refinery.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
To which a scoundrel clings.
It always does when you're with me.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
Leave no stone unturned.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
About an old man that never done wrong.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
Honey, I want you.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Everybody's having them dreams.
And relive my dreams.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
They seem determined to go all the way.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
With gold and silver in her hand.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
When you made everybody pay.
Is gonna be against the law.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
But you were tangled up in blue.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
He went down to Oxford Town.
They found him dead in the street one day.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Or define you or confine you.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Foundationed deep somehow.
You're too hot, darling.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Where I was born and partly raised.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Carry for you deep down inside.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
I just can't keep from crying.
Can't see over to the other side.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
So, darling, you better come through.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Six by six...
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
And I've never been too impressed.
In the dark land of the sun.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
"And light on my right knee.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
To anything I mighta tried.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
And I was brought up by my brother.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Trying to create a next world war.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Drifting too far from shore.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
'Steada acting like we never met.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
But with the country to where you're going.
I know they're not what they seem.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
From my toes up to my ears.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
Watch the parking meters.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
For that's the way I remember her best.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Lay dead beside him there.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
Who always was too proud to beg.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Soft as music, light as spring.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
You're a big girl now.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
Find out something only dead men know.
Please quit your low-down ways.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
My baby told me I would have to go.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
She pretends like we never have met.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Most of the time.
You're drifting too far from shore.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Please let me ride you home.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
And one day he came passing by.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
In the brightness of my day.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
In this concrete world full of souls.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
When he played and we didn't dance.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
You give something up for everything you gain.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
I'm younger than that now.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
While evening slips away.
And I need you, ah.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
Yes, tell me.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
At my window with a broken wing.
Crumble into one another.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
I know something is changed.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
But she had some way of finding them out.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
She's in some foreign land.
Epitome, rigidity.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Lost time is not found again.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
So the radio didn't work so well.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
You only got ten.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
If you won't come out your window.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
I'll be your baby tonight.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
All the friends I ever had are gone.

Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
His epitaph plain:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Yeah, serve somebody:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Serve somebody:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
But there's one promise, darling:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Till I come into New York town:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Make promises by the hour;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
I find complete love;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Crumble into one another;
Everybody that was hanging out;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Some speak of the future;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Had to be held down by big police;
So many things that we never will undo;
All lies and jest;

<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?"

Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>

<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Has anybody seen my love?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
And how does it feel?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Baby, can I come home with you?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
To love and follow His direction?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Does he change the course of rivers?
How can I live for You?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Why and what's the reason for?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
How many more without any reward?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Who you thought you were talking to?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Does anyone even try?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
What else can a poor boy do?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Before you call him a man?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
That too many people have died?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Where did you lose your wings?
What's wrong with you this time?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Just like a rolling stone?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Gal, where you been so long?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Can I come home with you?
Oh, so why not you and me?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
How could they let you go?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Am I ready?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
How much poison did they inhale?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Of everything you see?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
What would life be?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Is it rolling, Bob?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
How does it feel?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Where did you hide your halo?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Before they're forever banned?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
How come you don't send me no regards?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
How's everything in heaven?
How many more can they afford?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Baby, can't you tell?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Have they missed you?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
And one deserving of affection?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Across the swooping plain?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
The love that a stranger might receive?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
What can I do for You?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
For all these earthly things?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Why would I want to take your life?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Why must you always try to make me over?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Can you get back in?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
What do you think about that, my friend?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Must everybody bow?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Baby, what more can I tell?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
When did you leave heaven?
What good am I?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
How could they ever mistake you?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
By golly, what more can I say?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
What can I give to You?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Poor boy, where you been?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Too many people have died?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
When he's standing in front of you?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Before he can see the sky?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
How many compared to yesterday?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Before he can hear people cry?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Like a rolling stone?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Are you ready?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Oh, how could you refuse?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Across the swamp of time?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
How long are we gonna be riding?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Now, a very great man once said
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
But she ain't gonna find the road
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
But all that suffering was not to be compared
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
You try so hard, but you don't understand
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
There ain't nothing in this world
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Maybe someday you will understand
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
And those whom doom and death had spared
So I'll make my stand
It's something you did
Things would be different the next time we wed
But now something has changed
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
I will not go down under the ground
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Its iron claws attached
How many times can a man turn his head
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
We live in a political world
You used––be so proud
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Many times I've often prayed
Standing on the water, casting your bread
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
I've been walking around
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Now you don't seem so proud
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Now you don't act so––so proud
They took a clean-cut kid
I live in another world
I'll always thank the Lord
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
You used to be so amused
All the sweethearts you can hold
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
I want you, baby, just to understand
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
I thought that it was well-understood
Somebody seen him hanging around
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And then you told me later as I apologized
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
She let go of my hand
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
For what you sold that's not been received
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Everything stays down where it's wounded
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Just what you had in mind
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
And your trouble is you know it too good
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I run right home and I went to bed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
But something has changed
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
To see him obviously framed
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Roving gambler, he was very bored
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
He was a clean-cut kid
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Then came the warning that was before the flood
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And things would be different the next time we wed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
And into the path you are hurled
"Equality". I spoke the word
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Silvio, silver and gold
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Now, whenever I get up and
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
By no special friend
While some, on principles baptized
Nothing was delivered
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
The changes I was going through can't even be used
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
As I stand upon the sand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Well, six white horses that you did promise
I do declare
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Where I could watch her waltz for free
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
From all the plans they do pursue
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
While them that defend what they cannot see
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
It's all new to me
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
You into thinking you're the one
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
But I feel nothing for their game
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Should I leave them by your gate
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
You're not free to belong to me
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
A girl who would murder her own, true love
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
I can survive and I can endure
So I look like a walking mountain range
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
From the start by the rule
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
But I can't say I sympathize
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Just pick anyone
I am homeless, come and take me
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
And never sat once at the head of the table
Mona tried to tell me
If dogs run free, then what must be
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
But I can get another one
Says it's closing time
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
How many ears must one man have
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
She knows there's no success like failure
Limited in sex they dare
What's probably got you baffled more
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Just what you will say when you get home
Full of hope and desire
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Most of the time I can't even be sure
What about that millionaire
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
The crashing waves roll over me
I'm ready for to fade
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Waiting to find out what price
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
But the dark does die
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Better stay away from those
Though its shadow's metal badge
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
A bed that is never mine
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
But it won't be over till they clear his name
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
We see this empty cage now corrode
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
To show you something you seen before
If dogs run free, why not me
And I ain't complaining none
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Looking at hands for the lines that were
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
If dogs run free, why not we
What you're gonna say when you get home
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
And I'm just the same as anyone else
From the Golden Gate Bridge
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
You smiling through the fence at me
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Should I put them by your gate
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
I been wondering all about me
She been gone
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
You cut to the core
I don't even notice she gone
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
You say you're looking for someone
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
He'll see by his grave
Knows there's no success like failure
When the roses fade
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
And the Negro's name
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
So up she picked her babies three
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Well, it's all new to me
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Why wait any longer for the one you love
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Lies that life is black-and-white
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Up into some paradise
I'm sure you're the one to blame
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
You know, it's not even safe no more
"It's only you that he does crave
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
The cause was there before we came
Maybe someday you will look back and see
You said you'd never compromise
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
When Reilly's daughter got a message
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
So I remember every face
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
On the rising curve
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
And you see why it's so unique to be
How was I to know you'd be the one
To give the special one you seek a chance
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
I rode with him in a taxi once
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Remember me to the one who lives there
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
As he rises to fame
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
There were times when I was so lonesome
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
The man the authorities came to blame
And plenty time for good romance
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
She plunged him into well water where
It'll be with me unto the grave
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
What good am I then to others and me
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Remember me to one who lives there
It's getting dark, too dark to see
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
With all memory and fate
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
That she's the same one
Feel to moan, but unlike before
And suddenly there appeared before me
"Oh, father, you will surely die
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
When I'm all alone
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Little did I realize
And that is that one must always flush out his house
So, I called up the operator of time
They say don't come back no more
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Taking care of somebody nice
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
You just pick anyone
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
When the rain is blowing in your face
And I would send a message
Hunger pays a heavy price
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Among the lovely people living free
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
"That I might be gone a long, old time
At dawn my lover comes to me
All I feel is heat and flame
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Trust yourself
Oh, trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
The battle outside raging
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
The order is a-rapidly fading
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
But then a whistle will be blowing
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
For your weary toes to be touching
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
What am I saying? What am I knowing
You left me standing in the doorway crying
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
They're drinking up and walking
It's not a bad way to make a living
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
The order is rapidly fading
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
There's nothing in here moving
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Beyond here lies nothing
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Where the time and the tempo drag
Deceived me into thinking
She rode by night and came by morning
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
For your weary toes to be a-touching
If I was with her too long
Early in the morning, early in the morning
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
'Cause the battle outside raging
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And how I know I'll make it through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Then she told us how times were tough
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I have fallen far beneath
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You go north and you go south
Look out, the saints are coming through
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Well, there ain't no going back
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
The man in me will do nearly any task
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Shoot in the back
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
But they caught him and they brought him back
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
You turn around to take a final peek
Her voice once and talk
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
I wish she'd unlock
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
A-how does it feel
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Then why don't she tell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
As the last fire-truck from hell
They ask me how I feel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
He's sure got a lot of gall
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Ring bar, hard to tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
How does it feel
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
A girl by the whirlpool
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
He's taught in his school
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
All and all can only fall
But among the dead that were left on the hill
How many seas must a white dove sail
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
I chased me a woman up the hill
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
How many seas must the white dove sail
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Oh, how does it feel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Muttering small talk at the wall
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
And if my love is real
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
But I can hear another drum
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
So, one morning when the sun was warm
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
You better not chew gum
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
And remain as I am
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Now, they asked me to read a poem
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Two eyes took the aim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
"For you cannot relive them
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
You don't need a weatherman
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
That long, black train is pulling on down
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Guns and clubs followed him down
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
And the smell of their roses does not remain
How many roads must a man walk down
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
She got such a sweet disposition
Have died in battle or in vain
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
I figure maybe we're even
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Must meet the dawn
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Somebody new to beat on
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
As you sit on the box you keep him in
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
A-she takes just like a woman
As they rode him in custody down to the station
To my knowledge there's just one man
There was little to say, there was no conversation
But me, I expected it to happen
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
But the post office has been stolen
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
She said that all the railroad men
The ones that jump on the wagon
For the loser now might be later to win
Suicide remarks are torn
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
And the corner sign
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Darkness at the break of noon
But the second mother was with the seventh son
To remember the times when I was your only man
But it's hard to think on
He got that fortress on the mountain
She takes just like a woman
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
That long, black train is pulling down
And all their daughters put me down
And there's no exit in any direction
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
But I swear I see my reflection
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Well, you fake just like a woman
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Out of the shower comes a football man
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Advertising signs that con
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
For the loser now will be later to win
You take just like a woman
You need something to make it known
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
In the pigpen
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
I'll be waiting at the station
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
All their daughters put me down
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
And she wakes just like a woman
But all their daughters put me down
Their religion of the little ten women
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And you ache a-just like a woman
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
The next morning she had awoken
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
My love, she's like some raven
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Why did you trade heaven
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
How can the life of such a man
And she aches just like a woman
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
But the second mom was with the seventh son
From heights that they could not gain
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Trying to get a lead on
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Yes, and someone must explain
Nothing we can call our own
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Well, I'm hanging on
"Not me," said the gambling man
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
All I'd like you to do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Silvio, I gotta go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
There's nothing you can say or do
All I really wanna do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
There is a place you go
Every place I wanna go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
I walked down there and ended up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
The man in the coon-skin cap
What good am I while you softly weep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Aladdin and his lamp
How many times must a man look up
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Never no more do I wonder
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
And I don't even think about her
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
The wind howls like a hammer
I say, "Why you say that for
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
When only you are near
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I could feel a whole lot better
She took him by his long, yellow hair
My ship is in the harbor
For I am married to a house carpenter
You heard me saying a prayer for
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
For all eternity I think I will remember
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
At any moment you could go under
Still I say her love-words over
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
In one I was running and in another
So, don't fear if you hear
I close my eyes and I wonder
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I don't have to go far
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
Who came here from Cuba's door
The face of God will appear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
The lover who has just walked out your door
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Still I've always kind of missed her
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
All you boys better run for cover
But morning is clear
Alone you stand with nobody near
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
When you whispered in my ear
And tells me of her dreams
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Don't wear sandals
And so Patty calls the cops
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And the princess and the prince discuss
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
They whisper in the wings
People carry roses
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
As friends and other strangers
Seven days
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
That it's you and no one else that owns
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Six-time users
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
With a big bouquet of the roses
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Well, the ragman draws circles
Mama, you know, awaits the news
You can fall down on your knees
You should be made to wear earphones
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Now, you must provide some answers
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
But, though the masters make the rules
Don't follow leaders
And your father, to your sister he explains
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
To the cutting of fences
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And the poor white remains
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Her window's wide open, African trees
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Six-time losers
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Thinking of a series of dreams
To memorizing politics
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And I try to harmonize with songs
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
To sharpen the senses
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
He's not selling any alibis
People on the platforms
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
I try to tell it like it is
Good and bad, I define these terms
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Glide across the lonely years
At times I think there are no words
You never turned around to see the frowns
The empty-handed painter from your streets
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Girl by the whirlpool's
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And, though the masters make the rules
But still remains
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Romantic facts of musketeers
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
You know that he has no intentions
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
And then complains
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
I'd gladly confess
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
And inside it with the people made of molasses
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Statues made of matchsticks
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And without further notice asks you how it feels
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
True love can make a blade of grass
Wants eleven dollar bills
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
I'm gonna let you pass
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
You been hurt so many times
On the back of the fish truck that loads
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
What good am I if I say foolish things
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
With a fantastic collection of stamps
We living in times when men commit crimes
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
The cowboy angel rides
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
It don't take too long to find out
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
They tell me to be discreet
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
But, then again, there's only one I've met
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
And I, in my armor, turning about
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
But, if the arrow is straight
One more night the moon is shining bright
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Yet you know there is no answer fit
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
To hold each other tight
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Like a corkscrew to my heart
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
I got into the driver's seat
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Everyone still talks about
And, since my feet are now fast
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
They tell me revenge is sweet
I soon get some rest
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
He built a fire on Main Street
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
The slowest now will later be fast
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
How many years can a mountain exist
You're gonna get hit
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
You used to laugh–make fun about
One more night I will wait for the light
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
He really wasn't where it's at
Ain't it hard when you discover that
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Talking that the heat put
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Oh, everybody's got to eat
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Keep me set apart
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
You are there in the flickering light
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
With your pockets well protected at last
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Our Father would not like the way that you act
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
She seems too far out
I think that it's best
In the stillness of the midnight
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
By the way, that's a cute hat
You don't forget
Johnny's in the basement
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I'm on the pavement
Everything is always right
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
That might be all that you got
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Every new messenger bringing evil report
I'm moving after midnight
And the first one now will later be last
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
The slow one now will later be fast
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
You're hearing my heart beat
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Someday, everything is gonna be different
How many years can some people exist
So he never thinks straight
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
There's some people that
Plants in the bed, but
Wait for the morning light
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Without any doubt
You used to laugh about
In the precious winds they rot
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
It's just crazy being here with you
I just might have to come see you
I'll remember you
To be alone with you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I can be just like you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
To protect you and defend you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
And I tell this truth to you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
It only goes to show
Down every street there's a window
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
I'd sure like to know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
But sooner or later one of us must know
Don't it always a-go to show
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Yes, I'd sure like to know
He been living there three years now
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
The only one I know
Don't it always go to show
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Now, you're probably wondering by now
With only you in view
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Sooner or later one of us must know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Well, I'd sure like to know
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
He made the bells of freedom ring today
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
For them that think death's honesty
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Went to the doctor the very next day
The Spanish-American War had its day
Spouted out that liberty
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
How many times must the cannon balls fly
From phony jealousy
If I don't take the chance to try
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
I send you all my money
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
My ears hear a symphony
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
For them that think death––death's honesty
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
That I done it the way
Maggie says that many say
She knocked upon it anyway
But I can't deny
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
So I run down most hurriedly
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
And for His love they took His life away
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
And I'm leaving every day to run away
And the only tune my guitar could play
And it's up to you to say
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
She puts it to me plain as day
A cock is crowing far away
Or if you just want some company
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Well, I saw it advertised one day
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
But I wish there was something you would do or say
No, you'll not now or no other day
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Someone to get you flowers constantly
My mind weaves a symphony
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
So, I'm walking down your highway
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Is worth more than I could pay
But you can never steal away
Though I'd never say
She smiles, walks the other way
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Well, I'm walking down the highway
We banged the drum slowly
And the ladies treat me kindly
And that which you've given me today
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
For them that must obey authority
Don't you tell Henry
To those condemned to act accordingly
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
That I was just a puppet in a play
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
The same thing I would want today
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
I did not do it harmfully
She starts to speak, but he walks away
So they took him to the infirmary
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
You will not hear a laugh –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Private reasons – great or small –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Disconnect these cables––
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
I hope that you can hear––
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Ten thousand miles or more –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Havana–gee–
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Leave all the children home –
Ha–va–
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Whispering your secret emotion –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
How badly they were shocked –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
I'm sure it was not three –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
It can't be this way everywhere –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
For seven long years I courted Sally –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Hang out the whole next day –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Oh, my–
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
With no other choice except but for to go –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Indians camp along her border –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
To know where you are –
I got no idea what I want –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
I long to hold you in the night –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Havanagee–luh–
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
I a-hope you can hear––
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
That can win what's a-never been won –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
With notions his canoe was laden –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
As suicide remarks are torn –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Remember me to one who lives there –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
First degree and second degree –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Hava–na–
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
