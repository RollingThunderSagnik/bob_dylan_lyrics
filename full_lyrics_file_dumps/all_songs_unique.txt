Well, I need a woman, alright!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Yeah, man!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
I ain't different than anyone!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Good God!
Dance!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!

Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
I've got a million friends!

Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Woo!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Yippee!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!

Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
I've got the freight train blues!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!

Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
You must think I'm crazy!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
She's insane!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Alright, now!
Take me down to California, baby!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Them Reds did it!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Have it on Highway 61."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Come flowing down so free?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
You can't blame us at all."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
But we were tangled up in blue."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
You must know about my debutante."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
I can't find my knees."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
That you must always first forgive them."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
For that reason I will have to stay."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
I'll endow them onto thee."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
"I've had too much of your company,"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Would kill a little bird like me."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
I'll bring back my lady."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
And keep him good company."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
So write to her tenderly."
We'll both go home together."
"That way down Highway 61."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And punched my cigarette."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
But I know what you want."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
We'll both go off together."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
You can't blame me at all."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
We want folksingers here."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Has kindly assisted me home."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
"Have you seen dignity?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
And pretend that you never have met."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
God said, "On Highway 61."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Tangled up in blue."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
I'll see her soon, I know."
They look as white as snow."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
I would want again tomorrow."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
And have it on Highway 61."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
You and I'll never know."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
I'll apply them all to thee."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Will mourn for your return."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
From across that lonesome ocean."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
I didn't see you around."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
I love far better than thee."
He said, "Tell me about it."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
They look as dark as night."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
And hung on a willow tree."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
It's all for the love of thee."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Get on your horse and ride away."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Where you and I will unite."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Country'll grow."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
God knows you've got to weep,
For all intended purposes,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
I don't want to meet your kin,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Eh, in somebody's room,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I like the cool way you look at me,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
If you must cling to someone,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I once held her in my arms,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
For something that he never done,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Love don't have any place,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Go down to the river, babe,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
I'll go see them come down my way,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
And she makes love just like a woman,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Using every angle under the sun,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
God sees it all unfold,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I get my sweet reward,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Father who build the mountain so high,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Every nerve is analyzed,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
It's too bad he had to go,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
But you were gambling for support,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I just say no thanks,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
They say every distance is not near,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
To be one your own,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Looking for a new fool,
They say every man needs protection,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
God knows it's a struggle,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
On this new morning, new morning,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
And forget my pride,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Ain't no going back,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Up and down the block,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
It was you who came right through,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Out to the windy beach,
People going down to the ground,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Like a rolling stone,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
You need something to open up a new door,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Yesterday's just a memory,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Don't know what to do without it,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
But you're doing it again,
To have––be on your own,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
My hands can't feel to grip,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Come on, come on, stick together,
While riding on a train going west,
Whether you are right or wrong,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
The joint is jumping,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
And you take just like a woman,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
I just don't know what to do,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
When I was in Missouri,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
The Second World War came to an end,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
I won't have my nature way,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
"Come along and take a trip,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
I march in the parade of liberty,
My woman needs it every day,
God knows it's terrifying,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Not the end, not the end,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
To find out if she's talked,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Never did feel this way before,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
You can raise up your right hand,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
New morning,
I try my best to be like I am,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Alright, I'm so glad,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
And point away from the past,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Father of day, father of night,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
I can't cross the line, you know,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
He won't do nothing to you,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
May you stay forever young,
And comes to a permanent stop,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
God knows there's a heaven,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
A man with a badge skips by,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Dream about you, baby,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
How many times have you heard someone say,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
When the night comes falling,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
You have given me life to live,
Someone to close his heart,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
True love, they've been without it,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Yet every distance is not near,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
If today was not a crooked highway,
To hang and to lynch,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Carved next to his name,
In the foggy web of destiny,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
The night would see me wide awake,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
I thank the Lord,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
I just keep pressing on,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
I'm so glad,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I had so much left to do,
You have given everything to me,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Ye shall be a-changed,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
The one we can see and can feel,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
In the little church a-this side of town,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Watch the river flow,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Far past the frozen leaves,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
God don't call it treason,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
A complete unknown,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
But I know that he don't talk,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
To know how much I really care,
I went into the city, went into the town,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Searching everywhere I know,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
So glad,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Father of loneliness and pain,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
But ye shall be a-changed,
You always responded when I needed your help,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Eh, see what you can do,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
And, although that we're single and free,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
And ye shall be a-changed,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
I want you,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
If ever I prove false to you,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
They keep it all hid,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
While paupers change possessions,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Equality, liberty,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
All the silver, all the gold,
Tell her not to worry,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
How he died nobody can say,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Where the neon madmen climb,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
God knows how to make it flow,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
To a solid rock,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
May be an actor in a plot,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
I should have left this town this morning,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
She's the worst you could ever have,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Keep me where you are,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Baby, please stop crying,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Two by two they step in the dark,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
God knows there's a purpose,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Too noble to neglect,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Tell me,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
I got a bird that whistles,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
You could look at it and weep,
Had no one to go my bail,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Yes, I want you so bad,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
And it's only that I'm asking,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Nothing was delivered,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Stone you and say good luck,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
For the wise men and the fools,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
In one the surface was frozen,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Never weak, but always strong,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
I landed up on the downtown side,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
You gotta look some other place,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Oh, see what you can do,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
So I got those worries blues,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
"Not I," said the referee,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
I got no place left to turn,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Winter would have no spring,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Never needed to call you my whore,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Memory, ecstasy,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
You can run down to the desert,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Of ancient history,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Is looking for a new fool,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Go melt back in the night,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Better jump down the manhole,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
The kingdoms of experience,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
But, if I can save you any time,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
For his age he is wise,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Don't follow leaders,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
And she aches just like a woman,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
To be on your own,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
And I got those worried blues,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
If anything is gonna sell,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Broken hands on broken plows,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Thieving in the alley,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
The haunted, frightened trees,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Trust yourself,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Front door shut, back door too,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Every moon is so sanctified,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
The only son of God Almighty,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
At ships with tattooed sails,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
And I––I walk out on my own,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
And played the fife lowly,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Want you,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Eh, singing just for you,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
He been around the world and back again,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
But I'm pressing on,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
That long, black train is pulling down,
I don't wanna fake you out,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
You better chew gum,
Going, going,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
I think we better talk this over,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Too serious to fool,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
On the stone that remains,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
I just can't beg you anymore,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I had no one for to go my bail,
You stole her love from me one day,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
My hands didn't touch him none,
She once was a true love of mine,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Wintertime in New York town,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Just like I did before,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
That two healers cannot heal him,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Is used, it is plain,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
People talk over situations,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Oh, watered-down love,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Relationships of ownership,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Someone to open each and every door,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
They tell me every man must fall,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
It was from her ship sailing,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
I never can go because, you know,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
There she come, now, down my way,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Mixing up the medicine,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
A dream about you, baby,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
To your tambourine in time,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
More people kept a-piling on,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Just like a rolling stone,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Made of silver or of golden,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Grandpa died last week,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
I want you so bad,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
They must bust in early May,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
You got something better,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Poor boy dressed in black,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
It's a price I have to pay,
Most of the time it's well understood,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
All them prophets good and gone,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Father of night, father of day,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
For she ain't the same,
It always has hit me from below,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
See her in that very tight skirt,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
To keep up his hate,
Try hard, get barred,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
I went down to scrub and rub,
She'll be coming forth,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Something about you that I can't shake,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
I like the way that you move your hips,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
And gathering storms may arise,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Well, come all without, come all within,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
I bless the day I found you,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
A man named Martin Luther King,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
If you throw it all away,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
You'll change your last name, too,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
And the point is slick,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
With a killer's pride, security,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
That one doctor cannot save him,
She would have married me,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
You need something to open your eyes,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Ah, get sick, get well,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Of this I can't say very much,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
You and me, we had completeness,
You're beautiful to me,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
All the tired horses in the sun,
And there's two white horses following me,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
As the daylight hours do increase,
In the turning of twilight,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
I got my mind made up,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Serve somebody,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
When all will be well,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
And I don't want to drag you down,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Don't let her see,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Joey, Joey,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
My existence led by confusion boats,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
The train leaves at half past ten,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And it's like I ain't here,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
But, if you want me to,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
And it still ain't me, babe,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
You married young just like your ma,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
In his anger and his shame,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
God knows that, when you see it,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Speaking to some French girl,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
The light I never knowed,
I would not feel so all alone,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Bring the wife and family,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Oh, in somebody's room,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Well, I don't mind dying,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Light yourself a candle,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
One by one they followed the sun,
Try to be a success,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Like some mystery,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
So, never leave me lonely,
Go away from my window,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
And may you stay forever young,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Ever since I been a child,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
With what your fate is going to be,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
I been good while I been waiting,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Like a dog on a chain,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
They say everything can be replaced,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
But, deep inside my heart,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
True love of mine,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Father of black, father of white,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
But it ain't him to blame,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
With the juice running down my leg,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Strangers all give me the news,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Poor boy never say die,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
First degree and second degree,
Three angels up above the street,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
They say every man must fall,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
I got those worried blues,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
I wish tonight were here,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
They took a clean-cut kid,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Searching high, searching low,
She leave by the other and roam,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
They say that every man must fall,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
We'll go someplace unknown,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
And she'll be coming forth,
But it would not be new,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
God knows it's outta sight,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
I need a shot of love,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
"Not me," said his manager,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Beyond here lies nothing,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
I threw it all away,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
He's young and on fire,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Going, going, gone,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
She got great big hind legs,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
That her father was going to hang,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Oxford Town around the bend,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
This place ain't doing me any good,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Thank You, Lord,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Resent him to the bone,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
I went back home, put on my tie,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
And think they're fooling you,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Tears on the letter that I write,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
And give him back the time he's done,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Where life and death are memorized,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
When she lays upon the grass,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Says he's got a bad bill,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Rabbit running down across the road,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
If you'd see me this way,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
God knows when,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
People carry roses,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Precious father, loving mother,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Corrina, Corrina,
Without your sweet love,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
One by one they follow the sun,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
I'll be on my way,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Don't try No Doz,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Well, I can't understand,
Love that's pure no accident,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Look who's back in town,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
When I seen him lose control,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
I'm never, never far from home,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
The man there said he loved my sound,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
The day you quit me, baby,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
It's really something,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
By losers, cheaters,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Pressing on,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
God knows there's a chance,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I can't understand,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Far away in the stormy night,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Who could they get to carry you,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
All that and more and then some,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Puffing on a big cigar,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
I don't care if you feel like me,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Look away, you rolling river,
The man in the trench-coat,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
I love you, pretty baby,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
You have given all there is to give,
And you make love just like a woman,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Went to the station down in the yard,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Madams light the candles,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
In the great unknown,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Without a dream in my heart,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You want watered-down love,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
With his candle lit into the sun,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
And to come each time you call,
Stand up straight and tall,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Make you spin or do you in,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Somewhere down the road some day,
I'm leaving today,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
And, on their promises of paradise,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
At the close of the day,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
The day would surely have to break,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Over your senses you have no control,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Without ideals or violence,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
The winter would hold no spring,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
You broke a heart that loved you,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
But the time ain't tall,
Aim well, my little one,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Advertising signs, they con,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
My love, she speaks softly,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
King of the streets, child of clay,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
That the laws are with him,
It's like I ain't here,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
In the ruins of your balcony,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Maybe when we both get sober,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
And not going through any great extreme,
As the present now will later be past,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Why she did go,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Looking 'bout the government,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
And, if I see the day,
I went down where the vultures feed,
A million faces at my feet,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Laying low,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Don't let her know,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
It all seemed so well-timed,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
I can finish this alone, honey,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Waiting for the trains,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Precious memories, how they linger,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
In the instant that I preach,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
I found my world, found my world in you,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
The sky too is folding under you,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Or have done something wrong,
But now morning is clear,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Hmm, see what you can do,
I been riding the midnight train,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
By users, cheaters,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Says he's got a bad cough,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Well, I'm so glad,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Need a woman all the time,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
It's rising up above my head,
Don't let me change my heart,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
You will be alright, girl,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
But evidently she don't,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
You got something I want plenty of,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
My senses have been stripped,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Nothing too very scientific,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
They walk among the stately trees,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Seven days,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
As his youth now unfolds,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
See you fly or watch you die,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
My arms and legs were broken,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
God don't call it wrong,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
All I really wanna do,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
You were snow, you were rain,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Like you never did before,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
To strict party-platform ties,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Don't let me drift too far,
My limbs are shaking,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
You follow, find yourself at war,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
God knows there's a river,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Don't you tell Henry,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Can't find what I need,
May be the head of some big TV network,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
My dear, sweet friend,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
In love and with kindness,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
But, to remain as friends,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Simplify you, classify you,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Heart of mine, be still,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
They lowered him down as a king,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
I can make it through,
The country doctor rambles,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Take the motherless children off the street,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Friends with you,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
By rivers of blindness,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
You'll be doing society a favor,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
One by one until there were none,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
You don't have to feed me,
You made it there somehow,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
To gather flowers constantly,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Circled by the circus sands,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Where mercy walks the plank,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
God knows it's fragile,
Every brain is civilized,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
But I'm saved,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Like as not, it's better so,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I know I can't win,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
God knows everything,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Just remember that death is not the end,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Father of air and father of trees,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
But I've been hanging on,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
And, if I can save you any time,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
That five walls cannot hide him,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Human gods aim for their mark,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
How many a year has passed and gone,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
It still ain't me, babe,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
I have no one to meet,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
So unknown,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
To stay closer than any friend,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
We'll fly the night away,
I shall be released,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
In the lonely night,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
I can't be good, baby,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Or select you or dissect you,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Well, I may just swear,
Don't mind the driving rain,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
All you can do is do what you must,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
You've got to serve somebody,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Made before the foundation of the world,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Oh, Angelina,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
He is centuries old,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
In the end,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Don't let yourself fall,
To be––direction home,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Read books, repeat quotations,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Well, there ain't no going back,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
That fellow who never blushes,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Trouble,
Icicles hanging down,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Father of cold and father of heat,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
And here I sit so patiently,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
In the darkness of my night,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
I'd already gone the distance,
And I'm in the shade,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Stay away from the train line,
Gonna serve somebody,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
I'm pledging my time to you,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
A hand set the spark,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
I got a wife and five little children,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Living in the land of Nod,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
The sky too is folding over you,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
If I didn't have to guess,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
You got to serve somebody,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
I'd be sad and blue,
Don't wear sandals,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
But I will be back, I will survive,
But you try with your whole soul,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
I rambled out of New York town,
Judge and jury took their stand,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Badge out, laid off,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Don't steal, don't lift,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Get born, keep warm,
Forever young, forever young,
And on the highway of regret,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
For the politician's gain,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
You wanna drown love,
You to me were true,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I'd give you the sky high above,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
But, if I will save you the time,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
And I'm back in the rain,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Look out, kid,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
It's not aimed at anyone,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Into my own parade,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
People talk of situations,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
The beat is pumping,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
And the whole world is on your case,
And also by his feet,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Who will promise never to part,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
He's not selling any alibis,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
And it ain't me, babe,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
And, though the line is cut,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
But something has changed,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
And you know I could never be your own,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
A handle hid out in the dark,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Well, the way I love that woman,
To be alone with you,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Face full of black soot,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Well, get sick, get well,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Every head is so dignified,
You even make love just like a woman,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Is it really any wonder,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Hazel, you called and I came,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Far away and over the wall,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
I had a dream about you, baby,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
With his fist in a clinch,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
I went into the city, into the town,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
If'n you don't know by now,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Nothing that would pass inspection,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
The Communists was a-coming around,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
He's the property of Jesus,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
But the bottles are done,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Day you quit me, baby,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
But he can't be blamed,
Silhouetted by the sea,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
To shine in through,
That can do what's a-never been done,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
It always means so much,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
And I'm so glad,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
They run a brick and tile company,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
I fell down to my bended knees,
When there is no more,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
And furnish me with tape,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
We've killed each one,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Don't tie no bows,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Watching the river flow,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
We take great delight in our own company,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Don't put yourself over the line,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
And come every time you call,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
The air is getting hotter,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
She said she would never forget,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I've been saved – well, alright,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
They pass by so silently,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Hang around the ink-well,
She said she would always stay,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
They don't believe in mercy,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
That you'd have liked me to,
He got that soft, silky skin,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
When God and man will be reconciled,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
In another I witnessed a crime,
The night passed away so quickly,
Without a love of my own,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
I tried to reach you, honey,
They––they show me to the door,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Since you've been gone,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Giving back all of what you owe,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And every cause that ever I fought,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
If not for you,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Well, I been gambling so long,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
That can do what's never been done,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
I'd only have to stay,
Spent my money on you, honey,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
No direction home,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Oh, singing just for you,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Watered-down love,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Stone you just like they said they would,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
You find God in the church of your choice,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
We live in a political world,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Said I'm pressing on,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
The path you've endured has been rough,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Courage is a thing of the past,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Keep a clean nose,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Socialism, hypnotism,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Six months on the chain gang,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Like a complete unknown,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
I can see the turning of the key,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Just don't know what to do,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I try my best to be just like I am,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
You have given me eyes to see,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Now you don't talk so loud,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
I got the worried blues,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
It could even be like a myth,
God knows it's true,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Thinking about the government,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Got my mind made up,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
I want my arms around you,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Loyalty, unity,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
I went out last night to take a little round,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
To be without a home,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Don't let her hear,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Father of time and father of dreams,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
How does it feel,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
She'll surely turn to white,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
To protect his white skin,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Automobile coming into style,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Got me a secret membership card,
And, if anybody asks me,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
First to come in was the flying moth,
To be out on your own,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
To be so useless and all,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
I got two white horses following me,
Well, well, well,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
So many roads, so much at stake,
It don't matter what you did,
From their fates try to resign,
Just then the order came to charge,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Carry the New York Times,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
If she ain't feeling well,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Stripping away at it all,
Tell me that you love me only,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
And to come every time you call,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Want you so bad,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
She's opened up a happy home,
Private reasons, great or small,
Ye shall be changed,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
But, it ain't me, babe,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Under the microscope,
With no direction home,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
She never does me wrong,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
And your streets are getting empty,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Each one playing a horn,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
This situation can only get rougher,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Staying far behind without you,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Heart of mine,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Over the hills and far away,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
No, nothing was delivered,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
If you'd see me this a-way,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Mercury, gravity,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
You better duck down the alleyway,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Don't matter what you did,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
For her to arrive,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Only one thing I did wrong,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
A thousand miles from home,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
It's alright,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Drifting too far from shore,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Paradise, sacrifice,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Give you my money, honey,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
And I got the worried blues,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
I been good,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
You had enough of hatred,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
That must be what it's all about,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Where I will always be renewed,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Don't wanna be a bum,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
The country music station plays soft,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Far away from it all,
Went back home to the yard,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Cares not to come up any higher,
They say every man must need protection,
That fired the gun,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
You have explained every mystery,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
I'm going down the river,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
I long to see you in the morning light,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Better jump down a manhole,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Each time we meet, love,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
How he died nobody could say,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
I'm going back to Colorado,
There's always someone who understands,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
They say every man need protection,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
A true love of mine,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Drag you down or drain you down,
God knows it's a crime,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Going home,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
I can change, I swear,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
And I'm just like that bird,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Going,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
I'm going out of my mind,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Don't ever try to change me,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Saved,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Just to know that you are near,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Get back, write Braille,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
This world is ruled by violence,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Come all without, come all within,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
China doll, alcohol,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Had a dream about you, baby,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
But it ain't me, babe,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Precious angel under the sun,
Vanished from my hand,
In the hills of mystery,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
I've been around this whole country,
May be living in another country under another name,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
It hurts me, too,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
You were striped, you were plain,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Democracy don't rule the world --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
That's where you belong --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Crying out that he been framed.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
The place that I started from.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
For me to return to or chase.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
And light on your right knee.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
What some people are gonna do for money.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Yes, and I'll go last.
And the morning will be breaking.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Oh, convey herself away.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
She's in some foreign land.
I want everybody to be free.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
I seen a man.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I got nothing left to burn.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
He gone north for a while.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
My baby took my heart from me.
That's really and truly an American.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
A-lord, protect my child.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
You're a big girl all the way.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
I know you always say that you agree.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.

Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.

I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Like you never done before.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Finalize you or advertise you.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
I'll only let you down.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.

So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
Rode slowly back again.

Soft as music, light as spring.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Behind a man's brain.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Memories of what used to be.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
And laid his life on the line.
I stood wondering which way to go.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
Fighting every inch of the way.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
You can say I didn't give to you.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
I know they're not what they seem.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
I want you.
Drink up your blood like wine.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
Orders from the D.A.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

Find out something only dead men know.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.

That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Baby, please come home.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
But simply because it's true.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
Baby, let me follow you down.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
You want a watered-down love.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Never been so easy or so slow.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.

A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
Going through all these things twice.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
The whole world is my throne.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Adiós, mi corazón.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.

In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Everybody's having them dreams.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Well, I'm just thumping.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
And try to avoid the scandals.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Hoping you'll come through too.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Trying to create a next world war.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
But these to tell what's true.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
Suffering like a fool.
That keep us so tightly bound.
They got – all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
When she's better only time'll tell.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
I don't know any more than this.
Police at your back.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
And you only got ten.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
It sure is right on a night like this.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Oh, Angelina.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
Someone I really could care for.
Who says she knows me well.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
Billy, you're so far away from home.

The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Is what this thing here is for.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
My love, she speaks softly.
But it was more than I could do.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Chain you down or bring you down.
And one day he came passing by.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
You'd better get that in your head.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Honey, I want you.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
But I ain't neither one.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.

Until my dying-day.

We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
And she had left him to die in there.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
And you must realize the danger.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
He went down to Oxford Town.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
My heart is telling me I love you still.

He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
By that soft and shining sea.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
I always thought that he was well.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
Patriotism, materialism.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
Greenwich Village.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
And disregards the rest.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
And the sails are spread.
You don't have to be afraid.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Go lightly on the ground.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
To which a scoundrel clings.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
And then go on home and have my fun.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
Lay dead beside him there.
Thought I was a communist.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
I took some comfort there.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
All my connections too.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.

Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
And crime don't have a face.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Than people who are most content.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
Even before you came in the door.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
I followed the winding stream.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
The light I never knowed.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
And watch the parking meters.
"Don't point your finger at me.
The same as my father before him.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
I know something is changed.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.

With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
You're the only love I've ever known.
I froze right to the bone.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
And make promises by the hours.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Someone who will die for you and more.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.

I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
68, but says she's 24.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
You're gonna need my help someday.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
His mama sure was proud of him.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
A true love of mine.
That's the day you die.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Just crying out that he was framed.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
No kindred or relative nigh.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
Put me outta doors.
Waiting on my burying ground.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
The hour when the ship comes in.
It'll never do, somehow.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
That linger in the fireball heat.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
It always does when you're with me.
I can't fire them anymore.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
You break your promise all over the place.
Crying out that he was framed.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Every link was Jesus's name.
And I need you, yeah.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
In the border-towns of despair.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Epitome, rigidity.
It only brings me sorrow.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
For your times, they are a-changing.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
For that's the way I remember her best.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
And she'll only know he's dead.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
And wait for succeeding kings.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Friends with you.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
And it never seemed strange.
Ever since we've been apart.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
I'm falling in love with you.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
Until I threw it all away.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
In the night the price was paid.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
She said she would always stay.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
A man named Martin Luther King...
That must be what it's all about.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
And each one I've never seen again.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
"And light on my right knee.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
I can't see through it anymore.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Down to New Orleans.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
And guarded them as they fell.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
And the mailbox is locked.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
New morning.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
That brave and devoted band.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
You got it, baby.
Slowly into autumn.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Please let me ride you home.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
I can't use it anymore.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
But I can't get close to her at all.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
High society, notoriety.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
From the little Minnesota town.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Just you and me.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
You'll never see me frown.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
And no time to think.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
Got ice water in my veins.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
But with the country to where you're going.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
You're my baby.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Join the army if you fail.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Life don't mean a thing.
If you just let me come home with you.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
You're on the bottom.
But I would never do you wrong.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
So quickly into autumn.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
By the saving grace that's over me.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
And they gotta cut something.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
I would only let you down.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
In the pale moonlight.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
I only saw what they let me see.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
With my suitcase in my hand.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
My love winks, she does not bother.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Without this love that we call ours.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Must be and that is all.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Someone's watching over you.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
I said that.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
I'll remember you.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
I can't shoot them anymore.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
I been in this thing too long.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
If you throw it all away.
They don't make nothing here no more.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
I threw it all away.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
At my window with a broken wing.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Bid farewell forever.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Know not what the years may hold.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Hmm.
That just struck me kinda funny.
And there's no time to think.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
That I left in the French Quarter.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
Blowing through another no-good town.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
And all I see are dark eyes.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
That old ship was a-going down.
And time is beginning to crawl.
She saw her father's body broken.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
'Steada acting like we never met.
The country doctor rambles.
We were the wrong side.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
In the summertime when you were with me.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Rain would gather too.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
With the golden loom.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
At not getting their money's worth.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Lay your hand upon my head.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Chain you down or be your clown.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
They both rode off together.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
But you're back where you belong.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
The night will soon be gone.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Now you don't talk so loud.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
He could die happily ever after.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
Mortality, reality.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
I'll hold it down for you.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
And every window made of glass.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
You won't get it for money.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
And gives it to me for a song.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
And relive my dreams.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Mine alone.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
I see better days and I do better things.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Is gonna be against the law.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Humility, simplicity.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Far down the street we stray.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Hope I don't blow it.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
I been worrying about you, baby.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
That which is not permanent don't last.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Or stay all night with thee.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Figuring a way to get back home.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
And it is time for me to slide.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
It was you who understood.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Girls like birds fly away.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
Need that woman straight and true.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
There were six thousand people there.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
That's the way I remember her best.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
I don't even know why we come.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Watch the parking meters.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
That last night I was with.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
I just can't keep from crying.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Come on, baby.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Try to avoid the scandals.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
For the times, they are a-changing.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
I hope I'm ready.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
You give something up for everything you gain.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
Someone to open each and every door.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Headed out for the western skies.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Some place so high above the wall.
You can show me a new place to start.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Valentines can't buy her.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
I finally got a job in New York town.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
We may not make it through the night.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
Lost time is not found again.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
I'm not the one you need.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
May you stay forever young.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
With an iron chain around his neck.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
I didn't feel so cold then.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Some place so high above this wall.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
They would not let me be.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
All because his face was brown.
Or put up against the wall.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
To anything I might've tried.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
Baby, two feet from the well.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Our chances really was a million to one.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
That Johanna's not here.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
But you were tangled up in blue.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Come on, baby...
Your old road's rapidly aging.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Sweet lady.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.

I once held her in my arms.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Man is opposed to fair play:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
His epitaph plain:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Serve somebody:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Yeah, serve somebody:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
But there's one promise, darling:
Till I come into New York town:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Some speak of the future;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Make promises by the hour;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
So many things that we never will undo;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
I find complete love;
Everybody that was hanging out;
All lies and jest;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Crumble into one another;
Had to be held down by big police;
About everybody that was hanging out;

<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Across the swamp of time?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
How many compared to yesterday?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
What can I do for You?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Baby, what more can I tell?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Can I come home with you?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Of everything you see?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
When he's standing in front of you?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Who killed Davey Moore?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Just like a rolling stone?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Just what in the world has come over you?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Can you get back in?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Poor boy, where you been?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
What can I give to You?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
How long are we gonna be riding?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Oh, how could you refuse?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
The love that a stranger might receive?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Are you ready?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Did you respect me for what I did?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Like a rolling stone?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
How can I live for You?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Baby, can't you tell?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
How could they ever mistake you?
Why must you always try to make me over?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
How many paths did they try and fail?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Must everybody bow?
What would life be?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Why would I want to take your life?
Where did you hide your halo?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Have they missed you?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
How's everything in heaven?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Where did you lose your wings?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
How many more without any reward?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Before it's washed to the sea?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Before you call him a man?
Why and what's the reason for?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
By golly, what more can I say?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
For all these earthly things?
What's wrong with you this time?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
What good am I?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Before he can see the sky?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
When did you leave heaven?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
How come you don't send me no regards?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Am I ready?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Before they're forever banned?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
And one deserving of affection?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Gal, where you been so long?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Across the swooping plain?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Before he can hear people cry?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Does anyone even try?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
How could they let you go?
What else can a poor boy do?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
How does it feel?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
That too many people have died?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Too many people have died?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
How much poison did they inhale?
To love and follow His direction?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Has anybody seen my love?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
And how does it feel?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
How many more can they afford?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Just what you had in mind
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
We live in a political world
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Standing on the water, casting your bread
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
I've been walking around
I'll always thank the Lord
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
All the sweethearts you can hold
And your trouble is you know it too good
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Maybe someday you will understand
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Nothing was delivered
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
"Equality". I spoke the word
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And then you told me later as I apologized
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
While some, on principles baptized
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
And things would be different the next time we wed
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Its iron claws attached
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Things would be different the next time we wed
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Silvio, silver and gold
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
I run right home and I went to bed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
But all that suffering was not to be compared
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Now, a very great man once said
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Now you don't seem so proud
I thought that it was well-understood
By no special friend
He was a clean-cut kid
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Many times I've often prayed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
But now something has changed
How many times can a man turn his head
To see him obviously framed
You used––be so proud
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
You used to be so amused
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
And those whom doom and death had spared
And into the path you are hurled
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
I live in another world
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
I had to say something to strike him very weird
As I stand upon the sand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
But she ain't gonna find the road
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
I will not go down under the ground
I want you, baby, just to understand
They took a clean-cut kid
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
She let go of my hand
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Somebody seen him hanging around
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
So I'll make my stand
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Now you don't act so––so proud
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Then came the warning that was before the flood
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
But something has changed
For what you sold that's not been received
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
There ain't nothing in this world
You try so hard, but you don't understand
It's something you did
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Now, whenever I get up and
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
And the Negro's name
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Remember me to the one who lives there
So I look like a walking mountain range
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Where I could watch her waltz for free
What good am I then to others and me
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Just what you will say when you get home
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I don't even notice she gone
You into thinking you're the one
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Up into some paradise
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
From the start by the rule
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
You know, it's not even safe no more
You say you're looking for someone
A girl who would murder her own, true love
I can survive and I can endure
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Con you into thinking that you're the one
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
On the rising curve
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Limited in sex they dare
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Well, it's all new to me
To show you something you seen before
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Maybe someday you will look back and see
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Hunger pays a heavy price
Taking care of somebody nice
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Knows there's no success like failure
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
If dogs run free, then what must be
Should I put them by your gate
I rode with him in a taxi once
What's probably got you baffled more
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
To give the special one you seek a chance
You cut to the core
You could almost think that you're seeing double
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Better stay away from those
All I feel is heat and flame
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
She knows there's no success like failure
And I would send a message
"That I might be gone a long, old time
They say don't come back no more
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
And you see why it's so unique to be
You smiling through the fence at me
Little did I realize
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
I been wondering all about me
He'll see by his grave
Lies that life is black-and-white
And suddenly there appeared before me
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
When I'm all alone
I am homeless, come and take me
When the rain is blowing in your face
But the dark does die
"It's only you that he does crave
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Remember me to one who lives there
While them that defend what they cannot see
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
You said you'd never compromise
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
I do declare
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Well, six white horses that you did promise
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
The cause was there before we came
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
When Reilly's daughter got a message
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
So, I called up the operator of time
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
From all the plans they do pursue
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
If dogs run free, why not me
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
What you're gonna say when you get home
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
It'll be with me unto the grave
Should I leave them by your gate
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
She plunged him into well water where
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Most of the time I can't even be sure
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Why wait any longer for the one you love
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
And plenty time for good romance
And never sat once at the head of the table
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
It's getting dark, too dark to see
At dawn my lover comes to me
I'm ready for to fade
Though its shadow's metal badge
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
And I ain't complaining none
So I remember every face
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
The crashing waves roll over me
"Oh, father, you will surely die
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
From the Golden Gate Bridge
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
A bed that is never mine
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
So up she picked her babies three
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
With all memory and fate
And her silver-studded phantom cause
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
You're not free to belong to me
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Waiting to find out what price
The man the authorities came to blame
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
But I can get another one
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
But I feel nothing for their game
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
There were times when I was so lonesome
Full of hope and desire
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
She been gone
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
How was I to know you'd be the one
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Among the lovely people living free
Says it's closing time
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
When the roses fade
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
You just pick anyone
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
How many ears must one man have
Just pick anyone
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
That she's the same one
We see this empty cage now corrode
But I can't say I sympathize
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Mona tried to tell me
As he rises to fame
It's all new to me
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Looking at hands for the lines that were
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
What about that millionaire
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
If dogs run free, why not we
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Leaving men wholly, totally free
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Deceived me into thinking
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
It's not a bad way to make a living
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
But then a whistle will be blowing
Early in the morning, early in the morning
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
I can hear their hearts a-beating
They're drinking up and walking
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
You left me standing in the doorway crying
For your weary toes to be touching
There's nothing in here moving
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
I know that you know that I know that you show something
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
She rode by night and came by morning
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the cards are no good that you're holding
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And there's no telling who that it's naming
The order is a-rapidly fading
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Beyond here lies nothing
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
If I was with her too long
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
The battle outside raging
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
'Cause the battle outside raging
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Where the time and the tempo drag
The order is rapidly fading
For your weary toes to be a-touching
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
And how I know I'll make it through
Then she told us how times were tough
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
You go north and you go south
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I have fallen far beneath
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once and talk
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
The man in me will do nearly any task
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Well, there ain't no going back
Shoot in the back
You turn around to take a final peek
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
They ask me how I feel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
He's taught in his school
He's sure got a lot of gall
How many seas must a white dove sail
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
How many seas must the white dove sail
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
And if my love is real
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
As the last fire-truck from hell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
A-how does it feel
A girl by the whirlpool
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Oh, how does it feel
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Soul to soul our shadows roll
I chased me a woman up the hill
All and all can only fall
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Ring bar, hard to tell
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
How does it feel
Ring bell, hard to tell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Muttering small talk at the wall
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Well, if I die on top of the hill
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Then why don't she tell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
And remain as I am
But I can hear another drum
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
You better not chew gum
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
"For you cannot relive them
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Two eyes took the aim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
That long, black train is pulling down
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
She said that all the railroad men
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
But the second mother was with the seventh son
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Well, I'm hanging on
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Please don't let on that you knew me when
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
For the loser now might be later to win
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Will not be understood as they're spoken
I don't even care if I ever see her again
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
For the loser now will be later to win
Their religion of the little ten women
But it's hard to think on
Suicide remarks are torn
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
To my knowledge there's just one man
He got that fortress on the mountain
You need something to make it known
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Trying to get a lead on
I figure maybe we're even
There was little to say, there was no conversation
"Not me," said the gambling man
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
She got such a sweet disposition
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And she wakes just like a woman
You don't need a weatherman
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Nothing we can call our own
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Have died in battle or in vain
You take just like a woman
But I swear I see my reflection
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Yet I swear I see my reflection
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
In the pigpen
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
But the second mom was with the seventh son
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
The ones that jump on the wagon
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
She takes just like a woman
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
The next morning she had awoken
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
And the corner sign
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Somebody new to beat on
Must meet the dawn
A-she takes just like a woman
How can the life of such a man
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Advertising signs that con
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
But the post office has been stolen
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
But all their daughters put me down
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
And she aches just like a woman
Darkness at the break of noon
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Why did you trade heaven
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
And the smell of their roses does not remain
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
As they rode him in custody down to the station
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
I'll be waiting at the station
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Uncle Rat went running downtown
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
And all their daughters put me down
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
But me, I expected it to happen
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
And you ache a-just like a woman
All their daughters put me down
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Out of the shower comes a football man
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
That long, black train is pulling on down
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
To remember the times when I was your only man
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
How many roads must a man walk down
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Guns and clubs followed him down
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Yes, and someone must explain
My love, she's like some raven
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And there's no exit in any direction
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Well, you fake just like a woman
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
From heights that they could not gain
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Silvio, I gotta go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
The very last thing that I'd want to do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Every place I wanna go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
There's nothing you can say or do
All I'd like you to do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
There is a place you go
All I really wanna do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
What good am I while you softly weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
I walked down there and ended up
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
How many times must a man look up
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Aladdin and his lamp
The man in the coon-skin cap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Never no more do I wonder
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
The wind howls like a hammer
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Who came here from Cuba's door
But morning is clear
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
The face of God will appear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Still I've always kind of missed her
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
The lover who has just walked out your door
My ship is in the harbor
In one I was running and in another
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
I say, "Why you say that for
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
When you whispered in my ear
And I don't even think about her
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
You heard me saying a prayer for
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
All you boys better run for cover
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
She took him by his long, yellow hair
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
For all eternity I think I will remember
Alone you stand with nobody near
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
For I am married to a house carpenter
I don't have to go far
I close my eyes and I wonder
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
When only you are near
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
At any moment you could go under
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
So, don't fear if you hear
Still I say her love-words over
I could feel a whole lot better
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Wants eleven dollar bills
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
And the princess and the prince discuss
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
I was thinking of a series of dreams
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
I try to tell it like it is
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Girl by the whirlpool's
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
That it's you and no one else that owns
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
True love can make a blade of grass
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
When your mother sends back all your invitations
In the dimestores and bus-stations
But, though the masters make the rules
And the poor white remains
But still remains
Six-time losers
And then complains
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
You can fall down on your knees
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Six-time users
To sharpen the senses
Well, the ragman draws circles
Seven days
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
People on the platforms
I'd gladly confess
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
"Not me," said the man whose fists
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
As friends and other strangers
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
To the cutting of fences
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
To memorizing politics
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Her window's wide open, African trees
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
And tells me of her dreams
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And your father, to your sister he explains
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
And so Patty calls the cops
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Good and bad, I define these terms
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
The empty-handed painter from your streets
You know that he has no intentions
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Glide across the lonely years
Don't follow leaders
Now, you must provide some answers
The cowboy angel rides
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And inside it with the people made of molasses
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Thinking of a series of dreams
What good am I if I say foolish things
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Don't wear sandals
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
How many deaths will it take till he knows
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
People carry roses
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
They whisper in the wings
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Mama, you know, awaits the news
And I try to harmonize with songs
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
With a big bouquet of the roses
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
You should be made to wear earphones
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
I'm gonna let you pass
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
He's not selling any alibis
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
Romantic facts of musketeers
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And, though the masters make the rules
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
You never turned around to see the frowns
You been hurt so many times
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I let it slip gladly to my friends
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Statues made of matchsticks
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
At times I think there are no words
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
We living in times when men commit crimes
Without any doubt
You are there in the flickering light
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Everyone still talks about
How many years can a mountain exist
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
To hold each other tight
Johnny's in the basement
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Well, I finally started thinking straight
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
By the way, that's a cute hat
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
He really wasn't where it's at
And the first one now will later be last
I'm moving after midnight
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
With your pockets well protected at last
One more night I will wait for the light
The slowest now will later be fast
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
I soon get some rest
Well, early in the morning till late at night
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
He built a fire on Main Street
You used to laugh about
That might be all that you got
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Keep it in your mind and not forget
I think that it's best
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Keep me set apart
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
In the stillness of the midnight
Wait for the morning light
But, then again, there's only one I've met
So he never thinks straight
Yet you know there is no answer fit
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Our Father would not like the way that you act
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
You used to laugh–make fun about
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And I, in my armor, turning about
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
I got into the driver's seat
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
And, since my feet are now fast
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
I'm on the pavement
You're gonna get hit
In the precious winds they rot
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Plants in the bed, but
Like a corkscrew to my heart
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
One more night the moon is shining bright
Talking that the heat put
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
You're hearing my heart beat
It don't take too long to find out
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
The slow one now will later be fast
Everything is always right
They tell me revenge is sweet
They tell me to be discreet
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
There's some people that
How many years can some people exist
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
She seems too far out
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
But, if the arrow is straight
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Every new messenger bringing evil report
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
You don't forget
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
To protect you and defend you
I just might have to come see you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To be alone with you
And I tell this truth to you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I can be just like you
I'll remember you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
It's just crazy being here with you
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
But sooner or later one of us must know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
I'd sure like to know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
With only you in view
Down every street there's a window
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
The only one I know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Don't it always a-go to show
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Don't it always go to show
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Ring them bells for the chosen few
He been living there three years now
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Sooner or later one of us must know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
It only goes to show
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Well, I'd sure like to know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
From phony jealousy
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
I send you all my money
Well, I'm walking down the highway
So they took him to the infirmary
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
So, I'm walking down your highway
Went to the doctor the very next day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
And it's up to you to say
That I done it the way
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
The same thing I would want today
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Is worth more than I could pay
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
For them that think death's honesty
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
No, you'll not now or no other day
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
But I wish there was something you would do or say
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
And the only tune my guitar could play
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And that which you've given me today
She knocked upon it anyway
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Well, I saw it advertised one day
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
And I'm leaving every day to run away
But I can't deny
I did not do it harmfully
That I was just a puppet in a play
For them that must obey authority
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
She puts it to me plain as day
She smiles, walks the other way
And the ladies treat me kindly
A cock is crowing far away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
The Spanish-American War had its day
But you can never steal away
For them that think death––death's honesty
To those condemned to act accordingly
And for His love they took His life away
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Spouted out that liberty
Or if you just want some company
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
My mind weaves a symphony
My ears hear a symphony
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
So I run down most hurriedly
Don't you tell Henry
He made the bells of freedom ring today
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
If I don't take the chance to try
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Maggie says that many say
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Though I'd never say
We banged the drum slowly
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
You will not hear a laugh –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Remember me to one who lives there –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
To know where you are –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
How badly they were shocked –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Hang out the whole next day –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Disconnect these cables––
Private reasons – great or small –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
With no other choice except but for to go –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
I a-hope you can hear––
Leave all the children home –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Whispering your secret emotion –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
You say my kisses aren't like his –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Indians camp along her border –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Havanagee–luh–
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Ha–va–
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Turn, turn, turn again –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
It can't be this way everywhere –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
I got no idea what I want –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
I long to hold you in the night –
Haven't seen her since that night –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Oh, my–
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I hope that you can hear––
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
That can win what's a-never been won –
First degree and second degree –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
I'm sure it was not three –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Havana–gee–
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Hava–na–
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
