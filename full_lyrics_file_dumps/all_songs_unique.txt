You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!

Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Lordy, Lord!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!

Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Them Reds did it!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Looking for my lo and behold!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
My God, they killed Him!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!

Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
I figured they was in my TV set!
I got the freight train blues!
How they ever flood my soul!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
I ain't different than anyone!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
I've got the freight train blues!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Thank you!
Oh, no!
Start over!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
They got away!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Dance!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Yeah, man!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
I've got a million friends!
It was the mailman!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
So long, New York!

Watch out so you don't step on me!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
Howdy, East Orange!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Alright!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Woo-hoo!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Woo!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
She's insane!
Good God!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Betty Ross!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Well!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
You must think I'm crazy!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Hootenanny television!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
They was all over!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Goodnight!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
I wanna be yours!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Dignity never been photographed!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Oh!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Would kill a little bird like me."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
We'll both go home together."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
And have it on Highway 61."
I would want again tomorrow."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Where you and I will unite."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
And it's all for the love of thee."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
We want folksingers here."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
And pretend that you never have met."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
I can't find my knees."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
So write to her tenderly."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
I didn't see you around."
I'll see her soon, I know."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
"Is it easy to forget?"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Country'll grow."
Get on your horse and ride away."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
We'll both go off together."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Come flowing down so free?"
You and I'll never know."
And keep him good company."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
That you must always first forgive them."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
You say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
But I know what you want."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"Have you seen dignity?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Will mourn for your return."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
God said, "On Highway 61."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Tangled up in blue."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
It's all for the love of thee."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
I'll bring back my lady."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
You must know about my debutante."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Have it on Highway 61."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
And punched my cigarette."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
You can't blame us at all."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
They look as dark as night."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
And hung on a willow tree."
From across that lonesome ocean."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."

God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"

She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."

I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."

But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."

I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
I love far better than thee."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."

And you say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."

You seen what happened last time they started.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
That you'd have liked me to,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Went to the station down in the yard,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
I try my best to be like I am,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Don't let her know,
It don't matter what you did,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
A man named Martin Luther King,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
In the little church a-this side of town,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Under the microscope,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Hang around the ink-well,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
And on the highway of regret,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Oh, singing just for you,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
The train leaves at half past ten,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
God knows it's fragile,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
I went down where the vultures feed,
On the stone that remains,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
So I got those worries blues,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
People carry roses,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Look out, kid,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Watered-down love,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
People going down to the ground,
Made of silver or of golden,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
You even make love just like a woman,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Just like a rolling stone,
Resent him to the bone,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Holding his club like he was a king,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
In the instant that I preach,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
God knows when,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Come all without, come all within,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It's too bad he had to go,
You're beautiful beyond words,
And you make love just like a woman,
I'd only have to stay,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Oh, Angelina,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
In the darkness of my night,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Without ideals or violence,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
But now morning is clear,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
I threw it all away,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
God don't call it wrong,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Broken threads, broken springs,
To hang and to lynch,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Watch the river flow,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Roll, Willie, roll,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
The one we can see and can feel,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Spent my money on you, honey,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
The light I never knowed,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Over the hills and far away,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
The night passed away so quickly,
It all seemed so well-timed,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
God knows everything,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Don't let her know that you love her,
We'll go someplace unknown,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Ever since I been a child,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
It's a price I have to pay,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
I'll be on my way,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
If ever I prove false to you,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Pick you up every time you fall,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I'm never, never far from home,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Serve somebody,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
They say every man must need protection,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Newspapermen eating candy,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
If you'd see me this a-way,
I thank the Lord,
A true love of mine,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
God knows it's a struggle,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
When I was in Missouri,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Who could they get to carry you,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Cares not to come up any higher,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
But I'm saved,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
In the hills of mystery,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
To find out if she's talked,
Don't put yourself over the line,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
To be alone with you,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
And the point is slick,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
From their fates try to resign,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I been good while I been waiting,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
She's the worst you could ever have,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
My dear, sweet friend,
Father of minutes, father of days,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
It's like I ain't here,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Going home,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
But it ain't me, babe,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Look away, you rolling river,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
You need something to open up a new door,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
They say every man needs protection,
I wish tonight were here,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
That one doctor cannot save him,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
How does it feel,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
My hands can't feel to grip,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Already the fiesta has begun,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
It's rising up above my head,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
A man with a badge skips by,
My woman needs it every day,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Went back home to the yard,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
If you throw it all away,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Just then the order came to charge,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Who will promise never to part,
Forever young, forever young,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
And forget my pride,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
I should have left this town this morning,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Get dressed, get blessed,
I'll go see them come down my way,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
I got those worried blues,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
You better duck down the alleyway,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Where mercy walks the plank,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
The kingdoms of experience,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Tears on the letter that I write,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Better jump down the manhole,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
I just say no thanks,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
And not going through any great extreme,
Don't let yourself stumble,
And I'm back in the rain,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
God knows you ain't pretty,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
People talk of situations,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Carved next to his name,
I get my sweet reward,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
All I really wanna do,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
And it ain't me, babe,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
And think they're fooling you,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Thinking about the government,
She'll be coming forth,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
He's not selling any alibis,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
But you were gambling for support,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
I been good,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
But I would not feel so all alone,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
I've been around this whole country,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Of ancient history,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Go away from my window,
China doll, alcohol,
See you fly or watch you die,
Ah, get sick, get well,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
You made it there somehow,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
And I'm in the shade,
God sees it all unfold,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
You have given me life to live,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
And I––I walk out on my own,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
We've killed each one,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Stay away from the train line,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Most of the time it's well understood,
And also by his feet,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Circled by the circus sands,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Going, going, gone,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Three angels up above the street,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
A million faces at my feet,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Trust yourself,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Something about you that I can't shake,
In the end,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
But evidently she don't,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Loyalty, unity,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
To be out on your own,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
I got a wife and five little children,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
As human gods aim for their mark,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
To your tambourine in time,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
For all intended purposes,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
With the juice running down my leg,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
She's opened up a happy home,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Want you so bad,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
In one the surface was frozen,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
My limbs are shaking,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
For her to arrive,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I landed up on the downtown side,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Bring the wife and family,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
It was you who came right through,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Get jailed, jump bail,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Badge out, laid off,
To have––be on your own,
Well, the way I love that woman,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
I once held her in my arms,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Four by four, no illusion for,
By losers, cheaters,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Don't let her see that you need her,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
That can do what's a-never been done,
But I've been hanging on,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
But you're doing it again,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
If she ain't feeling well,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
May you stay forever young,
The sky too is folding over you,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Without a dream in my heart,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
I want my arms around you,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Broken hands on broken plows,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
That her father was going to hang,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
The day would surely have to break,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Can't find what I need,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Like you never did before,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Don't wear sandals,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
I don't care if you analyze me,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Everything's a-hers or his,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
You broke a heart that loved you,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
I had no one for to go my bail,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
I couldn't see where we were going,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
In the shadows of moonlight,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
And it's like I ain't here,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
The phone's tapped anyway,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
It could even be like a myth,
I try my best to be just like I am,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
And gathering storms may arise,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
To a solid rock,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
I'm so glad,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Too noble to neglect,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Don't tie no bows,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
You find God in the church of your choice,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Don't ever try to change me,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Now you don't talk so loud,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Don't let her see,
Keep me where you are,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
I need a shot of love,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Simplify you, classify you,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
That six diggers cannot bury him,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
In the lonely night,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Need a woman all the time,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
One by one until there were none,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
True love of mine,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Stone you just like they said they would,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
It was from her ship sailing,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
So, never leave me lonely,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And there's two white horses following me,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
For the wise men and the fools,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Eh, see what you can do,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
You stole her love from me one day,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
In the great unknown,
Speaking to some French girl,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
She got great big hind legs,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Just to know that you are near,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Don't follow leaders,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
I'm going back to Colorado,
And she makes love just like a woman,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Well, I'm so glad,
Never needed to call you my whore,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Oh, see what you can do,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
When God and man will be reconciled,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Heart of mine,
A handle hid out in the dark,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Get back, write Braille,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
And furnish me with tape,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Try to be a success,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Front door shut, back door too,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Made before the foundation of the world,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Stone you and say good luck,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Read books, repeat quotations,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
The sky too is folding under you,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
It's not aimed at anyone,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Into my own parade,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Till both of us fell by the way,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
You'll be doing society a favor,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
In the turning of twilight,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
If'n you don't know by now,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
"Not me," said his manager,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Father of day, father of night,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Thieving in the alley,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Tell me,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Beating for the dead that rise,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
You have given everything to me,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
I'm gonna let you pass,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Well, the job that you used to have,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Light yourself a candle,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
But something has changed,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I got no place left to turn,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Stripping away at it all,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I can't be good, baby,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
I got a bird that whistles,
And, although that we're single and free,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
And I'm so glad,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Tell me that you love me only,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Baby, let me follow you down,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
And it still ain't me, babe,
King of the streets, child of clay,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Don't mind the driving rain,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I'd already gone the distance,
She said she would never forget,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Well, get sick, get well,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
In his anger and his shame,
She leave by the other and roam,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
If you can't quit your sinning,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Father of loneliness and pain,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Or have done something wrong,
New morning,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
The Communists was a-coming around,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Seven days,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
I been riding the midnight train,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Just don't know what to do,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
We never much thought we could get very old,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
As his youth now unfolds,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Is it really any wonder,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
"Come along and take a trip,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Honey, I will meet you there,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
God don't call it treason,
I won't have my nature way,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
First degree and second degree,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Maybe when we both get sober,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
In a pine box for all eternity,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Human gods aim for their mark,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Just remember that death is not the end,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Father of night, father of day,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Well, well, well,
And, if I see the day,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Each time we meet, love,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
It always has hit me from below,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
He won't do nothing to you,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Rabbit running down across the road,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
And played the fife lowly,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Alright, I'm so glad,
If anything is gonna sell,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
You were striped, you were plain,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Searching high, searching low,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Laying low,
Every moon is so sanctified,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
I don't care if you feel like me,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Each one playing a horn,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
With his fist in a clinch,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
When I seen him lose control,
You got something I want plenty of,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Look who's back in town,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Go melt back in the night,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
God knows there's a river,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
God knows you've got to weep,
Wintertime in New York town,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
I can change, I swear,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
But ye shall be a-changed,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Go down to the river, babe,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
And come every time you call,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Winter would have no spring,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
So glad,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Well, I may just swear,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
The air is getting hotter,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Get born, keep warm,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
He is centuries old,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Dream about you, baby,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Tell her not to worry,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
You have given me eyes to see,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Every brain is civilized,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
You got something better,
All you can do is do what you must,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Oh, watered-down love,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
And may you stay forever young,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Friends with you,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
When there is no more,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
But I know that he don't talk,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Don't steal, don't lift,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
But, to remain as friends,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You've got to serve somebody,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
And the whole world is on your case,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Love that's pure no accident,
He got that soft, silky skin,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
You need something to open your eyes,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
At the close of the day,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Paradise, sacrifice,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
You'll change your last name, too,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Three by three they're turning the key,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Without your sweet love,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
God knows how to make it flow,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
They say every distance is not near,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
But the time ain't tall,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
We'll go out and see it sometime. We'll both just sit there and stare,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Thank You, Lord,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I shall be released,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Saved,
Is looking for a new fool,
Is used, it is plain,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
I went into the city, went into the town,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
A thousand miles from home,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
The country music station plays soft,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
To shine in through,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
They say that every man must fall,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
I've been all around the world, boys,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Since you've been gone,
Father of air and father of trees,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
To be so useless and all,
Don't matter what you did,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
They tell me every man must fall,
Stone you when you are young and able,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Yet every distance is not near,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
You married young just like your ma,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
God knows it's true,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
A complete unknown,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I want you so bad,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Face full of black soot,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Advertising signs, they con,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Well, I don't mind dying,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Don't let me change my heart,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
And she'll be coming forth,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
But I will be back, I will survive,
This situation can only get rougher,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
One more night the stars are in sight,
I'd give you the sky high above,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Wasn't making any great connection,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Never did feel this way before,
They say every man need protection,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Hmm, I can make it through,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
To be without a home,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Over your senses you have no control,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
That fellow who never blushes,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Too serious to fool,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
They keep it all hid,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Somewhere down the road some day,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
And it's only that I'm asking,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Stand up straight and tall,
May be living in another country under another name,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Whether you are right or wrong,
When she lays upon the grass,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Looking 'bout the government,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
A hand set the spark,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
God knows there's a purpose,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
They say everything can be replaced,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Or select you or dissect you,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
You can stick your head in the sand,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
To strict party-platform ties,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
I can see the turning of the key,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Ye shall be changed,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
May be the head of some big TV network,
If you'd see me this way,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
And you take just like a woman,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
I got the worried blues,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Don't let her see where you're going,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
He been around the world and back again,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Memory, ecstasy,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Puffing on a big cigar,
I found my world, found my world in you,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
I want you,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Just like I did before,
The man there said he loved my sound,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You can run down to the desert,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
And here I sit so patiently,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
It hurts me, too,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
She'll surely turn to white,
Don't let her hear,
I like the way that you move your hips,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
To be––direction home,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
You were snow, you were rain,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Of this I can't say very much,
Like a rolling stone,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
She never does me wrong,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
God knows that, when you see it,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
That foreign sound in your ear,
You better chew gum,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Give you my money, honey,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Not the end, not the end,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
That they do not respect in any degree,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Said I'm pressing on,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Carry the New York Times,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
I tried to reach you, honey,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Corrina, Corrina,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Ooh, watered-down love,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
If I didn't have to guess,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
The day you quit me, baby,
It's really something,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
All them prophets good and gone,
The night blows cold and rainy,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
I got two white horses following me,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Icicles hanging down,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
For something that he never done,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Don't try No Doz,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Drifting too far from shore,
By rivers of blindness,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Relationships of ownership,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
And comes to a permanent stop,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
One by one they follow the sun,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Pressing on,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
They don't believe in mercy,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
But you try with your whole soul,
As the present now will later be past,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
"Not I," said the referee,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
That must be what it's all about,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
You could look at it and weep,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
No, nothing was delivered,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Got my mind made up,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Well, I gave you all my money,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
A question in your nerves is lit,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
I know I can't win,
And, though the line is cut,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
While paupers change possessions,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
A dream about you, baby,
She would have married me,
Never weak, but always strong,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Adiós, mi corazón,
You got to serve somebody,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
In love and with kindness,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Don't let yourself fall,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Ain't no going back,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
I can make it through,
He's the property of Jesus,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Give what I got until I got no more,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
There's always someone who understands,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
And point away from the past,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
And I got those worried blues,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Private reasons, great or small,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
There she come, now, down my way,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
By users, cheaters,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
They say every man must fall,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
You gotta look some other place,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Looking for a new fool,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
So unknown,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
I can't understand,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Like a complete unknown,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Using every angle under the sun,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
I'm leaving today,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
The Second World War came to an end,
And she aches just like a woman,
And rivers that ran through every day,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
God knows there's a chance,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Bringing me all of your charms,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
To keep up his hate,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
And, if anybody asks me,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Precious angel under the sun,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Judge and jury took their stand,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Courage is a thing of the past,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
But, deep inside my heart,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
And to come every time you call,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Oxford Town around the bend,
It still ain't me, babe,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
My arms and legs were broken,
Far away in the stormy night,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Don't you tell Henry,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Precious father, loving mother,
Gonna serve somebody,
You and me, we had completeness,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
They must bust in early May,
They––they show me to the door,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
To be on your own,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
To protect his white skin,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Father of cold and father of heat,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
People talk over situations,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Far away and over the wall,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
The man in the trench-coat,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
To stay closer than any friend,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I went into the red, went into the black,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
This world is ruled by violence,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
The only son of God Almighty,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Fare thee well but for a while,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Every head is so dignified,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
It's alright,
God knows it's a crime,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
You can raise up your right hand,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
God knows it's outta sight,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
For his age he is wise,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Without a love of my own,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
True love, they've been without it,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
And you know I could never be your own,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
We live in a political world,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
The country doctor rambles,
One by one they followed the sun,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
But it ain't him to blame,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Oh, in somebody's room,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
I don't want to meet your kin,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Baby, please stop crying,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Strike another match, go start anew,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Heart of mine, be still,
How many a year has passed and gone,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Staying far behind without you,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
They lowered him down as a king,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
How he died nobody can say,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
It always means so much,
I went into the city, into the town,
Where life and death are memorized,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Joey, Joey,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Father of black, father of white,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
You wanna drown love,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
God knows it's terrifying,
But the bottles are done,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
I got my mind made up,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
While riding on a train going west,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Says he's got a bad bill,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
When the night comes falling,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Someone to open each and every door,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
And I got the worried blues,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
And give him back the time he's done,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
More people kept a-piling on,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
I just don't see why I should even care,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
If you must cling to someone,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
He's young and on fire,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Trouble,
I had so much left to do,
You don't have to feed me,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
You're beautiful to me,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
But, if I will save you the time,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Up and down the block,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Vanished from my hand,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Well, come all without, come all within,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
With a killer's pride, security,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
On this new morning, new morning,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Who among them would try to impress you,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Out to the windy beach,
I think we better talk this over,
Keep a clean nose,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Going, going,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Like as not, it's better so,
Like some mystery,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
To know how much I really care,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I bless the day I found you,
But he can't be blamed,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Why she did go,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Better jump down a manhole,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
God knows there's a heaven,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Searching everywhere I know,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
And your streets are getting empty,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Someone to close his heart,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
And I'm just like that bird,
Watching the river flow,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Grandpa died last week,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
That fired the gun,
But, if you want me to,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
We'll fly the night away,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
But I'm pressing on,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Hmm, see what you can do,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
And, if I can save you any time,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Madams light the candles,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
If not for you,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
I never can go because, you know,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
To gather flowers constantly,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
For she ain't the same,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Equality, liberty,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
You had enough of hatred,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Eh, singing just for you,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Waiting for the trains,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
That can do what's never been done,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Love don't have any place,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Drag you down or drain you down,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
I rambled out of New York town,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Every nerve is analyzed,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Make you spin or do you in,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
You to me were true,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
The winter would hold no spring,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Strangers all give me the news,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Nothing was delivered,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
In the ruins of your balcony,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
But, if I can save you any time,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
In another I witnessed a crime,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
And to come each time you call,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
I just don't know what to do,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Aim well, my little one,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
We take great delight in our own company,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Mixing up the medicine,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
You have given all there is to give,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
I have no one to meet,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
The beat is pumping,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Mercury, gravity,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
But it would not be new,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
That five walls cannot hide him,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
The night would see me wide awake,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
With what your fate is going to be,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Don't let me drift too far,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
My senses have been stripped,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Going,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
I'm going out of my mind,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Nothing too very scientific,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Far away from it all,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
I like the cool way you look at me,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
May be an actor in a plot,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Day you quit me, baby,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
They took a clean-cut kid,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Says he's got a bad cough,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
And pretend that we never have touched,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
She said she would always stay,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
I'm going down the river,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
You will be alright, girl,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Like a dog on a chain,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
How he died nobody could say,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Want you,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
That the laws are with him,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
I'd be sad and blue,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
I can finish this alone, honey,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Got me a secret membership card,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I would not feel so all alone,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
She once was a true love of mine,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
For the politician's gain,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Automobile coming into style,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
To hide 'neath a hood,
The joint is jumping,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Try hard, get barred,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Had no one to go my bail,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Six months on the chain gang,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Where I will always be renewed,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
I just keep pressing on,
When all will be well,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
With no direction home,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
All the silver, all the gold,
You have explained every mystery,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
My love, she speaks softly,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
You want watered-down love,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
That's where you belong --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Democracy don't rule the world --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Adiós, mi corazón.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.

God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.

Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.

On the caboose of the train.
Or inspect you or reject you.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Watch the parking meters.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.

I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
And without further notice he asks you how it feels.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.

You know the song in my heart.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.

You sound like a hillbilly.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
Behind a man's brain.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And relive my dreams.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.

But I ain't got Corrina.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
She pretends like we never have met.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.

For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
So long, honey babe.

Kisses she gave him three.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.

Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
Streets up there're lined with gold.

A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
Thought I was a communist.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
What looks like the easy way out.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Step lightly on the ground.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
It would go up against every rule.

One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.

But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
So many people I never saw in my life.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
But you're back where you belong.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
That's the way I remember her best.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
But mine was a little different, you see.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
I'd give anything to be with you.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
He gone north for a while.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Or put up against the wall.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
The same as my father before him.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.

The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
I remember her whispering yet.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Yes, tell me.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot".
Someone to open each and every door.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
And he was a friend of mine.
If I ride back again.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Waiting on my burying ground.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
You break your promise all over the place.
And shot it fulla holes.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
For the times, they are a-changing.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.

They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.

High society, notoriety.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Fear to bring children into the world.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.

I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
And keep away from pranks.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
And all your raging glory.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
My face you'll never see no more.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
You don't have to be afraid.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
I can't use it anymore.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.

May you always do for others and let others do for you.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
I never saw the man again.
And I want you to be that woman.
If'n you don't know by now.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Mine alone.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
It was a normal day.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Six by six...
Hear me singing through these tears.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Got ice water in my veins.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
If you throw it all away.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
I'm sad and lonely too.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
You may not see me tomorrow.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Never will want for money.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Tell me.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
To hold me in your arms.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
When I'm alone with you.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
She's in some foreign land.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.

They found him dead in the street one day.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
It hurts me, too.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
You'll do as much for me.

Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
I want everybody to be free.
His enemies say he's on their land.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
While the law looks the other way.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
I'm falling in love with you.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
When she's better only time'll tell.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Evidently she won't.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
To the old folks' home and the college.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
I been worrying about you, baby.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
I have heard rumors all over town.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
With your golden loom.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
Remember, before you come, at least please first telephone.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
She said she would always stay.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Rode slowly back again.
That old ship was a-going down.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
You are on the bottom.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
With the golden loom.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
Where teardrops fall.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
Duality, mortality.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Girls like birds fly away.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Throw my ticket out the window.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
And they gotta cut something.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Oh, her darling love she found.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
It's just the old American way.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
Crying out that he was framed.
I don't even know why we come.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Drink up your blood like wine.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Everything is gonna be fine.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Tangled up in blue.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
Soft as music, light as spring.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Oh, convey herself away.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
So the radio didn't work so well.
I don't know.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
And your golden loom.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
You're a big girl now.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
By the saving grace that's over me.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
And come away with me.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
And make promises by the hours.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
In my Cadillac.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Mama, you been on my mind.

Unless they're from another world.
And each one I've never seen again.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
I would only let you down.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
I want you.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
Have fallen from her curls.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a, a bone.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
I don't care what in the world you do.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Slowly into autumn.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Somebody better investigate soon.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Wants to get it paid off.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
The last radio is playing.
Hope I don't blow it.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
Oh, yes, they did.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
As if a wedding vow.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
When my working day's through.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
The next day could be your last.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
Well, I'm just thumping.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Gonna serve somebody.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
An innocent man in a living hell.
Who says she knows me well.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
Honey, come and see about me.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
The National Guard stands around his door.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
I just can't see through it anymore.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
Just like so many times before.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Please quit your low-down ways.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Honey, I never would have come.
Bring that bottle over here.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
I had something to protect.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
To kill with no pain.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
I'm not the one you need.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
They both rode off together.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Feel further away than ever before.
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Blood on your saddle.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
I'll be your baby tonight.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
But he sure left here in style.
Figuring a way to get back home.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
That Johanna's not here.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Is when I'm alone with you.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Rain would gather too.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Than people who are most content.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
A man named Martin Luther King...
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
You don't have to worry any more.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
You have no idea what you do to me.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Some speak of the future.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Greenwich Village.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Mortality, reality.
With the glory that is to be.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
For the saving grace that's over me.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
But you're not even sure what it is.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
So I beg you: let it be me.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Rain would gather, too.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
In the palace of the Pope.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Someone who will die for you and more.
Finalize you or advertise you.
To the sin of love's false security.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Just what he was talking about.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
I couldn't find any.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
I need a shot of love.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
But I was raised on the other.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
Havanageeluh.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Everything is gonna be alright.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom".
Under the hedges.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
About an old man that never done wrong.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Until my dying-day.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Saying wants company.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
And it never seemed strange.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
His voice was low with pain.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
I can't hear you anymore.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
From my toes up to my ears.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
I know something is changed.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
And light on your right knee.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
There's no words that need to be said.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
As the present now will later be past.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
It only brings me sorrow.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
A-lord, protect my child.
In the dark land of the sun.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
That must be what it's all about.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
You to me were the best.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Never been so easy or so slow.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books.
And try to avoid the scandals.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Up and down the lonesome town.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
Everybody that was hanging out.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
I see better days and I do better things.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
All because his face was brown.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Just remember that death is not the end.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Father of love and father of rain.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Magic in a magical land.
The hour that the ship comes in.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
The place that I started from.
Leading me, going home.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
Four by four they turn it some more.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
You're on the bottom.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Calling out that he's been framed.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
I can't fight them anymore.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Her fond face pale with woe.
And it is time for me to slide.
For an instant hand touched hand.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
I always thought that he was well.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
I just can't beg you anymore.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And I'll rock you too.
Just you and me.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
New morning.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Even the softest touch.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
I'll only let you down.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
It'll never do, somehow.
Go find out something only dead men know.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Crumble into one another.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Using ideas as my maps.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
At the sorority sisters' home.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
I hope I'm ready.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Going through all these things twice.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
I can't see through it anymore.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
Find out something only dead men know.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
And left me here facing the wall.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
It runs both cold and deep.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
Last radio is playing.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
That number eleven was closing.
I said that.
He's got his mother's eyes.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Remember me to one who lives there.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Lord, protect my child.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Please let me ride you home.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Come on, darling.
And your highway's getting filled.
Even before you came in the door.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
To live it you had to explode.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Or define you or confine you.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Everything is broken.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
But my heart just won't give in.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
I've seen trouble all my days.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
By the jealousy of others around her.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
And I's left alone with three children.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
I can walk anytime around the block.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
See him at play makes me smile.
You got a heart of stone.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Patriotism, materialism.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
All because of the color of his skin.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
Headed out for the western skies.
Now and forever let it be me.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Bid farewell forever.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
What's real and what is not.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Trust yourself.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Fighting every inch of the way.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Don't remember one thing more.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Nobility, humility.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
You'd better get that in your head.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
I'm younger than that now.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
I seen a man.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
In the border-towns of despair.
That which is not permanent don't last.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
My baby told me I would have to go.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Everybody's having them dreams.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
And ye shall be changed.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
Some place so high above this wall.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
My love winks, she does not bother.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
I'd like to know.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Who always was too proud to beg.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
And you must realize the danger.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
She acts like we never met.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
While evening slips away.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Look a-the other way.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
When you made everybody pay.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
He could die happily ever after.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And you only got ten.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
And the Santa Fe.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Join the army if you fail.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
I didn't realize how young you were.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
I finally got a job in New York town.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
They don't make nothing here no more.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Down to New Orleans.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
And the mailbox is locked.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend – no, I never seen him before.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Blues wrapped around my head.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
She can't find him anywhere.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
I got trouble in my mind.
And laid his life on the line.
"And light on my right knee.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
It ain't quite the end.
In the night the price was paid.
That last night I was with.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
You cast your spell and I went under.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
That's the day you die.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.

Come on, honey.

The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Hmm, tell me.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
All my connections too.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
And discovered her invisible self.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
I can't shoot them anymore.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
You're my baby.
Lay dead beside him there.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Because everybody must get stoned.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
And the morning will be breaking.
He ain't-a got no name.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
I only saw what they let me see.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
And the people that confronted him were many.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Hoping you'll come through too.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
The sooner you can go.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
It was you who understood.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
He's the neighborhood bully.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
They want me for a gambling fight.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
By that soft and shining sea.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Chain you down or be your clown.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
While my conscience explodes.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
And disregards the rest.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
I see that stationmaster too.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.

Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
It don't matter anyhow.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
I got a bird that sings.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
I's looking around just to see myself.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Baby, please come home.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
The light I never knowed.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
He's always on trial for just being born.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
In this concrete world full of souls.
May you stay forever young.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
But simply because it's true.
Just to take somebody's money away.
Without a love of my own.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.

All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.

Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Oh, Angelina.
People bending broken rules.

Know not what the years may hold.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
He's only a pawn in their game.

It's that million dollar bash.

Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
And I'll go last.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
The country doctor rambles.

Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.

Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.

Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.

But we're heading for a wall of stone.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.

The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.

That he not busy being born is busy dying.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
And tapestry of rhyme.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Hope you're ready.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
That's really and truly an American.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
I threw it all away.
Looking for a new friend.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
The sooner you can leave.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Serve somebody:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
But there's one promise, darling:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Yeah, serve somebody:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Till I come into New York town:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue:
His epitaph plain:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Had to be held down by big police;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
I find complete love;
Some speak of the future;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Make promises by the hour;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Everybody that was hanging out;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Crumble into one another;
All lies and jest;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>

<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>

<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>What?</i>
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
How could they let you go?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
To love and follow His direction?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
How come you don't send me no regards?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Does he change the course of rivers?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
How many compared to yesterday?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Across the swooping plain?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Why would I want to take your life?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Is it rolling, Bob?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Has anybody seen my love?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Must everybody bow?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
I seen better times, but who has not?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
That too many people have died?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
How does it feel?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
When he's standing in front of you?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
And one deserving of affection?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Before he can see the sky?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Why and what's the reason for?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
How many paths did they try and fail?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Gal, where you been so long?
But, something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How much poison did they inhale?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
By golly, what more can I say?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
What can I do for You?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
When did you leave heaven?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Before they're forever banned?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Too many people have died?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Baby, can't you tell?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Where did you hide your halo?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Am I ready?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
For all these earthly things?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
What would life be?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
How can I live for You?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Have they missed you?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
How many more without any reward?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
What good am I?
Across the swamp of time?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Before it is washed to the sea?
What can I give to You?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Just like a rolling stone?
How's everything in heaven?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
What else can a poor boy do?
What's wrong with you this time?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
How many more can they afford?
Before he can hear people cry?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Before they're allowed to be free?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Can you get back in?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
How could they ever mistake you?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Am I still dreaming yet?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
And how does it feel?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Does anyone even try?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Where did you lose your wings?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Are you ready?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Before it's washed to the sea?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Before you call him a man?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Of everything you see?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Who's gonna let it roll?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can I come home with you?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Like a rolling stone?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
It was put together down in Argentina
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
You have to pay to get outta
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
As I stand upon the sand
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
I want you, baby, just to understand
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
To see him obviously framed
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
She let go of my hand
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Things would be different the next time we wed
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Roving gambler, he was very bored
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Many times I've often prayed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
"Equality". I spoke the word
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Its iron claws attached
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
I run right home and I went to bed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Either from the mountains of Madrid
I thought that it was well-understood
I live in another world
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Silvio, silver and gold
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
There ain't nothing in this world
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
And then you told me later as I apologized
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
But all that suffering was not to be compared
I've been walking around
All the sweethearts you can hold
But now something has changed
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
You used to be so amused
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
It's something you did
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
And those whom doom and death had spared
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Now you don't act so––so proud
So I'll make my stand
But she ain't gonna find the road
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
And into the path you are hurled
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Maybe someday you will understand
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I'll always thank the Lord
I had to say something to strike him very weird
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
They took a clean-cut kid
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
The changes I was going through can't even be used
He was a clean-cut kid
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
While some, on principles baptized
I will not go down under the ground
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Now you don't seem so proud
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Standing on the water, casting your bread
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
You used––be so proud
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Now, a very great man once said
Nothing was delivered
And things would be different the next time we wed
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Then came the warning that was before the flood
And your trouble is you know it too good
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
By no special friend
How many times can a man turn his head
We live in a political world
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Just what you had in mind
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Now, whenever I get up and
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Somebody seen him hanging around
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
For what you sold that's not been received
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And the Negro's name
I been wondering all about me
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
What good am I then to others and me
Where I could watch her waltz for free
And I ain't complaining none
If dogs run free, why not we
Looking at hands for the lines that were
And plenty time for good romance
Just pick anyone
It'll be with me unto the grave
Says it's closing time
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
She been gone
That she's the same one
It's getting dark, too dark to see
If dogs run free, then what must be
So up she picked her babies three
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
So I remember every face
What's probably got you baffled more
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
You into thinking you're the one
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
You know, it's not even safe no more
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
I'm ready for to fade
You said you'd never compromise
With all memory and fate
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
But the dark does die
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
"Oh, father, you will surely die
When the roses fade
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
I can survive and I can endure
But I can get another one
On the rising curve
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
And never sat once at the head of the table
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
"That I might be gone a long, old time
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
The man the authorities came to blame
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
See the primitive wallflower freeze
You say you're looking for someone
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Maybe someday you will look back and see
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
When the rain is blowing in your face
Little did I realize
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
But I can't say I sympathize
Though its shadow's metal badge
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
You just pick anyone
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
How was I to know you'd be the one
She knows there's no success like failure
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Hunger pays a heavy price
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
When Reilly's daughter got a message
And I would send a message
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Lies that life is black-and-white
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
So, I called up the operator of time
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Knows there's no success like failure
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
The crashing waves roll over me
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
He'll see by his grave
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
A bed that is never mine
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
When I'm all alone
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
I'm sure you're the one to blame
They say don't come back no more
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
As he rises to fame
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Most of the time I can't even be sure
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Remember me to one who lives there
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Waiting to find out what price
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Should I put them by your gate
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
There were times when I was so lonesome
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Up into some paradise
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
We see this empty cage now corrode
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
She plunged him into well water where
Mona tried to tell me
Just what you will say when you get home
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
From all the plans they do pursue
So I look like a walking mountain range
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
While them that defend what they cannot see
What about that millionaire
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
To show you something you seen before
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
I don't even notice she gone
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
From the Golden Gate Bridge
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And suddenly there appeared before me
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
It's all new to me
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Full of hope and desire
You're not free to belong to me
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
All I feel is heat and flame
Leaving men wholly, totally free
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
The cause was there before we came
At dawn my lover comes to me
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Remember me to the one who lives there
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
How many ears must one man have
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
To give the special one you seek a chance
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
You cut to the core
"It's only you that he does crave
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
If dogs run free, why not me
Why wait any longer for the one you love
I am homeless, come and take me
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
A girl who would murder her own, true love
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Taking care of somebody nice
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
But I feel nothing for their game
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Among the lovely people living free
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
I do declare
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
From the start by the rule
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
And you see why it's so unique to be
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Should I leave them by your gate
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Better stay away from those
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
I rode with him in a taxi once
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Breaking hearts up and down the line
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Limited in sex they dare
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
But then a whistle will be blowing
And there's no telling who that it's naming
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
For your weary toes to be touching
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
The order is rapidly fading
You left me standing in the doorway crying
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
The battle outside raging
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
They're drinking up and walking
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
It's not a bad way to make a living
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
If I was with her too long
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
There's nothing in here moving
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Where the time and the tempo drag
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Well, I set my monkey on the log
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
What am I saying? What am I knowing
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
She rode by night and came by morning
The order is a-rapidly fading
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Deceived me into thinking
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
'Cause the battle outside raging
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I have fallen far beneath
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Look out, the saints are coming through
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And how I know I'll make it through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Then she told us how times were tough
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You go north and you go south
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Well, there ain't no going back
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Her voice once and talk
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
But they caught him and they brought him back
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
I wish she'd unlock
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Shoot in the back
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
The man in me will do nearly any task
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
You turn around to take a final peek
To make all that should be killed to crawl
They ask me how I feel
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
He's sure got a lot of gall
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
A girl by the whirlpool
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
How many seas must a white dove sail
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And if my love is real
Then why don't she tell
Ring bar, hard to tell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
He's taught in his school
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
How does it feel
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
How many seas must the white dove sail
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Well, if I die on top of the hill
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
As the last fire-truck from hell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Muttering small talk at the wall
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
I chased me a woman up the hill
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
A-how does it feel
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
But among the dead that were left on the hill
All and all can only fall
Ring bell, hard to tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Oh, how does it feel
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
So, one morning when the sun was warm
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
You better not chew gum
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Two eyes took the aim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
And remain as I am
But I can hear another drum
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Now, they asked me to read a poem
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
"For you cannot relive them
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Must meet the dawn
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
The ones that jump on the wagon
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Please don't let on that you knew me when
A-she takes just like a woman
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
In ceremonies of the horsemen
But the second mom was with the seventh son
How many roads must a man walk down
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
She takes just like a woman
And the smell of their roses does not remain
To my knowledge there's just one man
And she wakes just like a woman
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Guns and clubs followed him down
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
But all their daughters put me down
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
And you ache a-just like a woman
I'll be waiting at the station
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Advertising signs that con
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Somebody new to beat on
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Will not be understood as they're spoken
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Have died in battle or in vain
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Yes, and someone must explain
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
But it's hard to think on
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
My love, she's like some raven
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
That long, black train is pulling down
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
All their daughters put me down
You take just like a woman
Out of the shower comes a football man
And there's no exit in any direction
He got that fortress on the mountain
The next morning she had awoken
But me, I expected it to happen
Darkness at the break of noon
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
She said that all the railroad men
But I swear I see my reflection
From heights that they could not gain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
And the corner sign
How can the life of such a man
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And all their daughters put me down
You don't need a weatherman
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Why did you trade heaven
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
And she aches just like a woman
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
In the pigpen
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Trying to get a lead on
Well, you fake just like a woman
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Well, I'm hanging on
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
For the loser now might be later to win
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Uncle Rat went running downtown
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
"Not me," said the gambling man
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
I figure maybe we're even
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Their religion of the little ten women
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
But the post office has been stolen
For the loser now will be later to win
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
You need something to make it known
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Suicide remarks are torn
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
She got such a sweet disposition
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
That long, black train is pulling on down
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
To remember the times when I was your only man
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
The very last thing that I'd want to do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Silvio, I gotta go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
There's nothing you can say or do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
There is a place you go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All I'd like you to do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Every place I wanna go
All I really wanna do
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
The man in the coon-skin cap
How many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
I walked down there and ended up
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Man in the coon-skin cap
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
What good am I while you softly weep
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Aladdin and his lamp
I could feel a whole lot better
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Who came here from Cuba's door
Still I've always kind of missed her
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
At any moment you could go under
The face of God will appear
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
For all eternity I think I will remember
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Alone you stand with nobody near
I close my eyes and I wonder
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
I say, "Why you say that for
You heard me saying a prayer for
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
All you boys better run for cover
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I don't have to go far
The lover who has just walked out your door
For I am married to a house carpenter
But morning is clear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
The wind howls like a hammer
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
When only you are near
She took him by his long, yellow hair
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
When you whispered in my ear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
So, don't fear if you hear
And I don't even think about her
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
In one I was running and in another
Still I say her love-words over
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Never no more do I wonder
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
You know that he has no intentions
Good and bad, I define these terms
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And the poor white remains
Thinking of a series of dreams
Wants eleven dollar bills
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
As friends and other strangers
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
I'd gladly confess
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the princess and the prince discuss
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Now, you must provide some answers
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Her window's wide open, African trees
And, though the masters make the rules
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
True love can make a blade of grass
What good am I if I say foolish things
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
At times I think there are no words
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
And I try to harmonize with songs
But, though the masters make the rules
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
And without further notice asks you how it feels
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Don't wear sandals
People carry roses
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
How many deaths will it take till he knows
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
And then complains
You should be made to wear earphones
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And tells me of her dreams
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
You been hurt so many times
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And so Patty calls the cops
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Glide across the lonely years
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
They whisper in the wings
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Girl by the whirlpool's
I was thinking of a series of dreams
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Six-time users
People on the platforms
I'm gonna let you pass
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
With a fantastic collection of stamps
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
That it's you and no one else that owns
But still remains
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Well, the ragman draws circles
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Statues made of matchsticks
Don't follow leaders
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
To the cutting of fences
On the back of the fish truck that loads
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
The cowboy angel rides
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Romantic facts of musketeers
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
The empty-handed painter from your streets
You never turned around to see the frowns
We living in times when men commit crimes
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
To sharpen the senses
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Seven days
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
He's not selling any alibis
You can fall down on your knees
Six-time losers
And your father, to your sister he explains
With a big bouquet of the roses
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
I try to tell it like it is
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
To memorizing politics
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
We can hold up a toast if we meet
How many years can a mountain exist
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Oh, everybody's got to eat
To hold each other tight
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
By the way, that's a cute hat
You used to laugh about
She seems too far out
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
In the precious winds they rot
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
But, if the arrow is straight
Everyone still talks about
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
And the first one now will later be last
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
He really wasn't where it's at
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
And, since my feet are now fast
Our Father would not like the way that you act
One more night the moon is shining bright
So he never thinks straight
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
The slow one now will later be fast
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
Ain't it hard when you discover that
You don't forget
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And I, in my armor, turning about
Well, early in the morning till late at night
You used to laugh–make fun about
Without any doubt
You're hearing my heart beat
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
That might be all that you got
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
How many years can some people exist
Someday, everything is gonna be different
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Plants in the bed, but
In the stillness of the midnight
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
The slowest now will later be fast
Wait for the morning light
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
I soon get some rest
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Yet you know there is no answer fit
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
They tell me revenge is sweet
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Keep me set apart
I'm on the pavement
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
I think that it's best
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Johnny's in the basement
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Keep it in your mind and not forget
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
With your pockets well protected at last
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
And no one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
You're gonna get hit
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
It don't take too long to find out
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
You are there in the flickering light
No one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
One more night I will wait for the light
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
There's some people that
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Everything is always right
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
I got into the driver's seat
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Every new messenger bringing evil report
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
They tell me to be discreet
Talking that the heat put
He built a fire on Main Street
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I'll remember you
I just might have to come see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
And I tell this truth to you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
It's just crazy being here with you
I can be just like you
To protect you and defend you
To be alone with you
Ring them bells for the chosen few
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Well, I'd sure like to know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Sooner or later one of us must know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
The only one I know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
It only goes to show
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
With only you in view
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
But sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Don't it always go to show
I'd sure like to know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always a-go to show
He been living there three years now
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And the only tune my guitar could play
Someone to get you flowers constantly
That I done it the way
Spouted out that liberty
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
If I don't take the chance to try
But I wish there was something you would do or say
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
From phony jealousy
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
My ears hear a symphony
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Or if you just want some company
But you can never steal away
She smiles, walks the other way
I did not do it harmfully
So they took him to the infirmary
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
The Spanish-American War had its day
He made the bells of freedom ring today
To those condemned to act accordingly
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Went to the doctor the very next day
And for His love they took His life away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
So, I'm walking down your highway
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
We banged the drum slowly
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
For them that think death––death's honesty
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
But I can't deny
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
No, you'll not now or no other day
So I run down most hurriedly
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
My mind weaves a symphony
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
And that which you've given me today
Don't you tell Henry
She knocked upon it anyway
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Though I'd never say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
The same thing I would want today
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
That I was just a puppet in a play
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
And the ladies treat me kindly
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
A cock is crowing far away
For them that think death's honesty
And I'm leaving every day to run away
For them that must obey authority
I send you all my money
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
And it's up to you to say
She puts it to me plain as day
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Is worth more than I could pay
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Maggie says that many say
She starts to speak, but he walks away
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
You will not hear a laugh –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Oh, my–
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
I hope that you can hear––
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
You should be made to be wearing a telephone –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
First degree and second degree –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
That can win what's a-never been won –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
With notions his canoe was laden –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Havana–gee–
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Ten thousand miles or more –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Leave all the children home –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Private reasons – great or small –
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Without a reply I left by the moon –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
I long to hold you in the night –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
I a-hope you can hear––
Indians camp along her border –
Turn, turn, turn again –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
What you're gonna say when you get home –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
To know where you are –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Remember me to one who lives there –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Hang out the whole next day –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
As suicide remarks are torn –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
There oughtta be a law against you coming around –
Disconnect these cables––
I'm sure it was not three –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Hava–na–
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
I got no idea what I want –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
How badly they were shocked –
Ha–va–
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Havanagee–luh–
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
