And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!

He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!

You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Dignity never been photographed!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
I figured they was in my TV set!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!

Hootenanny television!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!

Pale face fit into place, oh, please!

Step it up and go, yeah, man!

Well!
Oh, yeah!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
It was the mailman!
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
So write to her tenderly."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
It's all for the love of thee."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
God said, "On Highway 61."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Would kill a little bird like me."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Tangled up in blue."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Where you and I will unite."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
From across that lonesome ocean."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
I can't find my knees."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Get on your horse and ride away."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
You say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
For that reason I will have to stay."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
You can't blame us at all."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
We'll both go off together."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
They look as white as snow."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
I'll see her soon, I know."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
And hung on a willow tree."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
I'll bring back my lady."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
And keep him good company."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
He said, "Tell me about it."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
You and I'll never know."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
"Have you seen dignity?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
And you say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
I would want again tomorrow."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
That you must always first forgive them."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Country'll grow."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
And punched my cigarette."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
You must know about my debutante."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Have it on Highway 61."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
And it's all for the love of thee."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
We'll both go home together."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Will mourn for your return."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
I love far better than thee."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
But I know what you want."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
They look as dark as night."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
"Is it easy to forget?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
You can't blame me at all."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
"That way down Highway 61."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
We want folksingers here."
And have it on Highway 61."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Come flowing down so free?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
And says, "Here's your throat back, thanks for the loan."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
And pretend that you never have met."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
I didn't see you around."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
But we were tangled up in blue."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Circled by the circus sands,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
You got something I want plenty of,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
It's really something,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
You have given me life to live,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
But I know that he don't talk,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Five by five they tried to survive,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Far away from it all,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
God knows it's terrifying,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
It all seemed so well-timed,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
It still ain't me, babe,
That can do what's a-never been done,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Don't wanna be a bum,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
You need something to open up a new door,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
If you'd see me this way,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Ever since I been a child,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Never weak, but always strong,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
You've got to serve somebody,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
And every cause that ever I fought,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And, although that we're single and free,
Socialism, hypnotism,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Memory, ecstasy,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Precious father, loving mother,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
May be the head of some big TV network,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Father of time and father of dreams,
But you were gambling for support,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Friends with you,
That can do what's never been done,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
She'll be coming forth,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Maybe when we both get sober,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Mercury, gravity,
The haunted, frightened trees,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
I got those worried blues,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
I won't have my nature way,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
In the hills of mystery,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
And here I sit so patiently,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
My love, she speaks softly,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
I fell down to my bended knees,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Every head is so dignified,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
With his candle lit into the sun,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
She'll surely turn to white,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
I can't cross the line, you know,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
But, it ain't me, babe,
To have––be on your own,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
To be out on your own,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Tell me,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Thank You, Lord,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Well, I don't mind dying,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
When all will be well,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
In the ruins of your balcony,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Ye shall be changed,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Going, going,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Light yourself a candle,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Not the end, not the end,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
In one the surface was frozen,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
And you make love just like a woman,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
All them prophets good and gone,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Oh, Angelina,
Thieving in the alley,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Well, I can't understand,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Without a dream in my heart,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Like a rolling stone,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
For the wise men and the fools,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Baby, please stop crying,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
And you know I could never be your own,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
And you take just like a woman,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
She's opened up a happy home,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Well, well, well,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Don't let me change my heart,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Puffing on a big cigar,
It always has hit me from below,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Ah, get sick, get well,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Stand up straight and tall,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
I got two white horses following me,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Till both of us fell by the way,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
From their fates try to resign,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
The sky too is folding under you,
She leave by the other and roam,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And she makes love just like a woman,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
He's not selling any alibis,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
In the foggy web of destiny,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
And I'm back in the rain,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Far away and over the wall,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
The beat is pumping,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Like some mystery,
Carved next to his name,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Six months on the chain gang,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
She once was a true love of mine,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
People carry roses,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Never did feel this way before,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
But something has changed,
Resent him to the bone,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Oh, singing just for you,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
But I've been hanging on,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
To hang and to lynch,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You will be alright, girl,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Nothing was delivered,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Three by three they're turning the key,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
It's like I ain't here,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Father of air and father of trees,
Father of black, father of white,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
You want watered-down love,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
I've been around this whole country,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Hold me, baby, be near,
There's always someone who understands,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Automobile coming into style,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
To find out if she's talked,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
I need a shot of love,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Broken hands on broken plows,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Seven days,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Bringing me all of your charms,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Go down to the river, babe,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Don't let her know,
Stone you and say good luck,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Don't wear sandals,
I shall be released,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
I swung on to my old guitar,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
King of the streets, child of clay,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Is used, it is plain,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Tell me that you love me only,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
I can't understand,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
That the laws are with him,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
We'll go out and see it sometime. We'll both just sit there and stare,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Just don't know what to do,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
You're beautiful beyond words,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
China doll, alcohol,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Went to the station down in the yard,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Every nerve is analyzed,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Don't you tell Henry,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
You say my kisses are not like his,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Go away from my window,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
My love, she speaks like silence,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Can't find what I need,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
I rambled out of New York town,
I long to see you in the morning light,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
You'll be doing society a favor,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
People going down to the ground,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Better jump down the manhole,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
And the point is slick,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
And furnish me with tape,
You were striped, you were plain,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
They must bust in early May,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
For all intended purposes,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
I landed up on the downtown side,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
But now morning is clear,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
I try my best to be like I am,
And also by his feet,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Go melt back in the night,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
I run right home and I went to bed,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
And to come each time you call,
If today was not a crooked highway,
The air is getting hotter,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
You better chew gum,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
And, if anybody asks me,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
He been around the world and back again,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
You had enough of hatred,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
But he's the property of Jesus,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
The day you quit me, baby,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
To hide 'neath a hood,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
God knows when,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
And she'll be coming forth,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
You stole her love from me one day,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
In another I witnessed a crime,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
My woman's never sitting at home,
And think they're fooling you,
Just like I did before,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
I had so much left to do,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
When there is no more,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Well, I may just swear,
Over the hills and far away,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Got me a secret membership card,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
All I really wanna do,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Each one playing a horn,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Madams light the candles,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
It hurts me, too,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
It always means so much,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
The kingdoms of experience,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Every brain is civilized,
God sees it all unfold,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
That five walls cannot hide him,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
It could even be like a myth,
God knows there's a river,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
When I seen him lose control,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
To strict party-platform ties,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
The light I never knowed,
Drifting too far from shore,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Had no one to go my bail,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
I'm never, never far from home,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Day you quit me, baby,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Oxford Town around the bend,
If not for you,
Ain't no going back,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Without ideals or violence,
I can see the turning of the key,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Well, I been gambling so long,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
In the little church a-this side of town,
God knows it's a crime,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
In the end,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
That foreign sound in your ear,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
On the stone that remains,
I get my sweet reward,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Vanished from my hand,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
And the whole world is on your case,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
You'll change your last name, too,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Something about you that I can't shake,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Judge and jury took their stand,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Searching high, searching low,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
In the turning of twilight,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
And I'm just like that bird,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Who could they get to carry you,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
But, to remain as friends,
It's not aimed at anyone,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Tell her not to worry,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
And I got the worried blues,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Using every angle under the sun,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
She's the worst you could ever have,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
They took a clean-cut kid,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
You can run down to the desert,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Of ancient history,
Looking 'bout the government,
He's the property of Jesus,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
With no direction home,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Carry the New York Times,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Get back, write Braille,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Don't let her see where you're going,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Bring the wife and family,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
It was a girl I learned it from,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
That fired the gun,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Someone to close his heart,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Equality, liberty,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
And your streets are getting empty,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Rabbit running down across the road,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
To be alone with you,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
When the night comes falling,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
One by one they followed the sun,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
You have given everything to me,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
And gathering storms may arise,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Well, the job that you used to have,
With his fist in a clinch,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Eh, see what you can do,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
That long, black train is pulling down,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Look away, you rolling river,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
He is centuries old,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
I'm going down the river,
Winter would have no spring,
You have given all there is to give,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
By users, cheaters,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
And I––I walk out on my own,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
God knows it's a struggle,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Where I will always be renewed,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
One by one until there were none,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Don't ever try to change me,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
I'd give you the sky high above,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Advertising signs, they con,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I went into the city, went into the town,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Don't let me drift too far,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
And joined the John Birch Society,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Broken switches, broken gates,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
All the tired horses in the sun,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
They say every man must fall,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Yes, I want you so bad,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Made before the foundation of the world,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
You were snow, you were rain,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
That fellow who never blushes,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Just like a rolling stone,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Get dressed, get blessed,
I been good,
You got something better,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Giving back all of what you owe,
At the close of the day,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
If she ain't feeling well,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
To your tambourine in time,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
How he died nobody can say,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Corrina, Corrina,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
In the shadows of moonlight,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Wintertime in New York town,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Try hard, get barred,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
You always responded when I needed your help,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
You got to serve somebody,
Like as not, it's better so,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
I wish tonight were here,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Eh, singing just for you,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
No, nothing was delivered,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
But he can't be blamed,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
The sky too is folding over you,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
My arms and legs were broken,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
And forget my pride,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Joey, Joey,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
By losers, cheaters,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
If ever I prove false to you,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
I can't be good, baby,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
They don't believe in mercy,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Over your senses you have no control,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
While riding on a train going west,
I can change, I swear,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
God knows that, when you see it,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Under the microscope,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
For the politician's gain,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Searching everywhere I know,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Got my mind made up,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
And I got those worried blues,
She got great big hind legs,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I'm so glad,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Fare thee well but for a while,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
It don't matter what you did,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
"Not I," said the referee,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
May you stay forever young,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Serve somebody,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Don't matter what you did,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
The man there said he loved my sound,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Broken idols, broken heads,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Mixing up the medicine,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Well, get sick, get well,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Love that's pure no accident,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
You married young just like your ma,
At ships with tattooed sails,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Holding his club like he was a king,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
I just say no thanks,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Look who's back in town,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Dream about you, baby,
They say every distance is not near,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
The man in the trench-coat,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Far away in the stormy night,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
My dear, sweet friend,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Oh, see what you can do,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Father of cold and father of heat,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Loyalty, unity,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Staying far behind without you,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I don't want to meet your kin,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
My limbs are shaking,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Heart of mine,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Hazel, you called and I came,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Made of silver or of golden,
We'll go someplace unknown,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
When I was in Missouri,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
And I'm so glad,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Of this I can't say very much,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
So glad,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Nothing too very scientific,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
A man with a badge skips by,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Aim well, my little one,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
And come every time you call,
New morning,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Why she did go,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
God knows there's a purpose,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
I can finish this alone, honey,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
But I'm pressing on,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Watching the river flow,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Get born, keep warm,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
The only son of God Almighty,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Front door shut, back door too,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Says he's got a bad cough,
In the darkness of my night,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Like a complete unknown,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Watered-down love,
Take the motherless children off the street,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
God knows you've got to weep,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
The angels play on their horns all day,
I got a bird that whistles,
God knows it's fragile,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
And she aches just like a woman,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Badge out, laid off,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
I want you so bad,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
I would not feel so all alone,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
When you think that you've lost everything,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
You could look at it and weep,
Better jump down a manhole,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
And it's like I ain't here,
To know how much I really care,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Analyze you, categorize you,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
I bless the day I found you,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
I know I can't win,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
I'm going out of my mind,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I can make it through,
God don't call it treason,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
God knows how to make it flow,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
It's rising up above my head,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
True love, they've been without it,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
To keep up his hate,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Human gods aim for their mark,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
So I got those worries blues,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
One summer's day he came passing by,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Watch the river flow,
With what your fate is going to be,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I've been all around the world, boys,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
A dream about you, baby,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
May be living in another country under another name,
Father of day, father of night,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Don't follow leaders,
Newspapermen eating candy,
You need something to open your eyes,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And to come every time you call,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
All the silver, all the gold,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
And rivers that ran through every day,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Said I'm pressing on,
We take great delight in our own company,
My senses have been stripped,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I have no one to meet,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Precious angel under the sun,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Precious memories, how they linger,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Give what I got until I got no more,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
"Not me," said his manager,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
But you're doing it again,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Without your sweet love,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Laying low,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Someone to open each and every door,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
You can stick your head in the sand,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Private reasons, great or small,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Since you've been gone,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Don't let her see,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Out to the windy beach,
You have given me eyes to see,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
This situation can only get rougher,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Is looking for a new fool,
"Come along and take a trip,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
He won't do nothing to you,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
How he died nobody could say,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I'd only have to stay,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Don't tie no bows,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
So unknown,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
They lowered him down as a king,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
I thank the Lord,
You have explained every mystery,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Who will promise never to part,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
A hand set the spark,
Three angels up above the street,
And it's only that I'm asking,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
I been good while I been waiting,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Keep a clean nose,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
A million faces at my feet,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
But evidently she don't,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Don't try No Doz,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
When she lays upon the grass,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
More people kept a-piling on,
So, never leave me lonely,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
But the bottles are done,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
If you throw it all away,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Well, I'm so glad,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
And, if I see the day,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
She would have married me,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
They tell me every man must fall,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Yes, and I'll go last,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
I'm leaving today,
Grandpa died last week,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Relationships of ownership,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Face full of black soot,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
It was you who came right through,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
But you try with your whole soul,
One by one they follow the sun,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Father who build the mountain so high,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Is it really any wonder,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
To be without a home,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
If you must cling to someone,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
That you'd have liked me to,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
That her father was going to hang,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
And point away from the past,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I want my arms around you,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
You have laid down Your life for me,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
On this new morning, new morning,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
I should have left this town this morning,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Everything's a-hers or his,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
They say every man need protection,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
For she ain't the same,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
But, if I will save you the time,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
The country music station plays soft,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Trouble,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
I went into the red, went into the black,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
You don't have to feed me,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
To be on your own,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Just remember that death is not the end,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Two by two they step in the dark,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
To gather flowers constantly,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
A thousand miles from home,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Going,
How does it feel,
When God and man will be reconciled,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
The night would see me wide awake,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
They––they show me to the door,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
To shine in through,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
If'n you don't know by now,
Want you so bad,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Pressing on,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
In the instant that I preach,
With a killer's pride, security,
And they––they look at me and frown,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Saved,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Into my own parade,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
God knows it's outta sight,
Simplify you, classify you,
Honey, I will meet you there,
They say everything can be replaced,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Oh, watered-down love,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Well, come all without, come all within,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
I want you,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
And it ain't me, babe,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
I been riding the midnight train,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
You can raise up your right hand,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
I got the worried blues,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
May be an actor in a plot,
My woman needs it every day,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
There she come, now, down my way,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
This world is ruled by violence,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
They say every man must need protection,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
See her in that very tight skirt,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I just keep pressing on,
I think we better talk this over,
Waiting for the trains,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
You made it there somehow,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
But the time ain't tall,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I'd be sad and blue,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
You even make love just like a woman,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
See you fly or watch you die,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Yet every distance is not near,
For his age he is wise,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
God don't call it wrong,
As his youth now unfolds,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Where life and death are memorized,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
First degree and second degree,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
God knows there's a chance,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Come all without, come all within,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
But it ain't him to blame,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I've been in and out of happiness,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Don't let yourself stumble,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
You and me, we had completeness,
Father of night, father of day,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
To a solid rock,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
The joint is jumping,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
In his anger and his shame,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
And on the highway of regret,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Up and down the block,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
The Second World War came to an end,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
The night passed away so quickly,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
She never does me wrong,
Father of loneliness and pain,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
I got a wife and five little children,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I march in the parade of liberty,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
You to me were true,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
By rivers of blindness,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
And, though the line is cut,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
God knows there's a heaven,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Or have done something wrong,
I once held her in my arms,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
It was from her ship sailing,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Stay away from the train line,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
And played the fife lowly,
Don't let her hear,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
We'll fly the night away,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Like a dog on a chain,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
People talk over situations,
It's alright,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
He's young and on fire,
But, if I can save you any time,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Stripping away at it all,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Stone you when you are young and able,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
For something that he never done,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
It's too bad he had to go,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
I never can go because, you know,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
In the lonely night,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
The country doctor rambles,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Each time we meet, love,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
We live in a political world,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
In the great unknown,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
You better duck down the alleyway,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Too serious to fool,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
In love and with kindness,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Need a woman all the time,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
As human gods aim for their mark,
You're beautiful to me,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
As the present now will later be past,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
I got my mind made up,
You gotta look some other place,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
The one we can see and can feel,
Or select you or dissect you,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
And ye shall be a-changed,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Make you spin or do you in,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Going, going, gone,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I'd already gone the distance,
But I'm saved,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
I'll be on my way,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
They keep it all hid,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
That must be what it's all about,
I went into the city, into the town,
All you can do is do what you must,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Icicles hanging down,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Speaking to some French girl,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
As the daylight hours do increase,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Strangers all give me the news,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
And give him back the time he's done,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
For her to arrive,
I got no place left to turn,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
And not going through any great extreme,
Try to be a success,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Love don't have any place,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
While paupers change possessions,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
To protect his white skin,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
God knows it's true,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
They say every man needs protection,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
I threw it all away,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
And may you stay forever young,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
To be––direction home,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Want you,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
A complete unknown,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I went down where the vultures feed,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
I just don't know what to do,
Look out, kid,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
And the table's full and overflowed,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Heart of mine, go back home,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Looking for a new fool,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
True love of mine,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
We've killed each one,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
She said she would never forget,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Too noble to neglect,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
People talk of situations,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
But, if you want me to,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
She said she would always stay,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Like you never did before,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Went back home to the yard,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
And I don't want to drag you down,
A true love of mine,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
How many a year has passed and gone,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
You wanna drown love,
The winter would hold no spring,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
God knows everything,
Trust yourself,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Keep me where you are,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Well, I gave you all my money,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Just then the order came to charge,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
But it ain't me, babe,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
The wind blowing the snow around,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Going home,
But, deep inside my heart,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
And comes to a permanent stop,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Most of the time it's well understood,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Hang around the ink-well,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
If I didn't have to guess,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Just to know that you are near,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Heart of mine, be still,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Don't let yourself fall,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Thinking about the government,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
And, if I can save you any time,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
It's a price I have to pay,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
The day would surely have to break,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Gonna serve somebody,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
To stay closer than any friend,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
But it would not be new,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
With the juice running down my leg,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
If anything is gonna sell,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Forever young, forever young,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
To be so useless and all,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Give you my money, honey,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
You can hear them tires squeal,
They say that every man must fall,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
And there's two white horses following me,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I like the way that you move your hips,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Without a love of my own,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
And I'm in the shade,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Democracy don't rule the world --
That's where you belong --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.

Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.

They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Without a love of my own.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.

And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
My love winks, she does not bother.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
In the palace of the Pope.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
To live it you had to explode.
I don't even know why we come.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Everybody's having them dreams.
A man named Martin Luther King...
Just like the time before and the time before that.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
To anything I mighta tried.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
They would not let me be.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Under the hedges.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
I froze right to the bone.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
To the old folks' home and the college.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Come on, baby.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Just remember that death is not the end.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
That I left in the French Quarter.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
I got a bird that sings.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
But you break just like a little girl.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Feel further away than ever before.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Rode slowly back again.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Now you don't talk so loud.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Oh, yes, they did.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And tapestry of rhyme.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
'Steada acting like we never met.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
And ye shall be changed.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
That set everybody free.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
Close your eyes, close the door.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
She acts like we never met.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
She once was a true love of mine.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
All because his face was brown.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Carry for you deep down inside.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Don't remember one thing more.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
I can't see through it anymore.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Honey, come and see about me.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
With the glory that is to be.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Come over here from over there, girl.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
He ain't-a got no name.
And there's no time to think.
Going back where we come from.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Crying out that he was framed.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
Until I threw it all away.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Havanageeluh.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
While the law looks the other way.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
So, darling, you better come through.
From the little Minnesota town.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
I had something to protect.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Hope I don't blow it.
Come on, honey.
Crying out that he been framed.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Memories of what used to be.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
I can't fire them anymore.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
To which a scoundrel clings.
There was nobody around.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Some speak of the future.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
All because of the color of his skin.
Until my dying-day.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
It always does when you're with me.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
If you just let me come home with you.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
I'd like to know.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
If not for you.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
They don't make nothing here no more.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
While I'm in the hall.
And the Santa Fe.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
But simply because it's true.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
And pretend that we never have touched.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
I got nothing to go back to now.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
And crime don't have a face.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
So the radio didn't work so well.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
See him at play makes me smile.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
I stood wondering which way to go.
You cast your spell and I went under.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
The same as my father before him.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Drink up your blood like wine.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
No kindred or relative nigh.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
I want everybody to be free.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Or put up against the wall.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
It was a normal day.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
With gold and silver in her hand.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Honey, I want you.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Gonna serve somebody.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
The whole night through.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
They found him dead in the street one day.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.

With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.

Either one of us could do what we do best.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Everybody must get stoned.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
I just can't beg you anymore.
Lay dead beside him there.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
She can't find him anywhere.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.

And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.

And left me here facing the wall.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.

Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Honey, baby.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
I have heard rumors all over town.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.

And I need you, ah, yeah.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.

"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Neighborhood bully.
You want a watered-down love.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.

I was looking around, I was outta sight.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.

Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
For the saving grace that's over me.
When I run outta things to investigate.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
The last radio is playing.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
You'll do as much for me.

There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
I just go pump on it some.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
And I'll rock you too.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
That Johanna's not here.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
His mama sure was proud of him.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.

Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
What you'll say when you get home.
You don't have to be afraid.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Headed out for the western skies.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Can't see over to the other side.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
Just what this song is all about.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
He's the neighborhood bully.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
"And stay all night with me.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.

I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.

We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
Looking for a new friend.
About an old man that never done wrong.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.

You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
That can win what's never been won.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.

Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
If you won't come out your window.
The light I never knowed.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
To kill with no pain.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
It was you who understood.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Oh, Angelina.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.

There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
See like me or be like me.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
You're a big girl all the way.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.

To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
I'd give anything to be with you.

Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.

And one day he came passing by.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend – no, I never seen him before.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
Well, I saw you making love with him – you forgot to close the garage door.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Till your error you clearly learn.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
You're my honey.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
I once held her in my arms.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
I'm going where I never been before.
For an instant hand touched hand.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Now and forever let it be me.
At the sorority sisters' home.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.

He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
I got trouble in my mind.
She pretends like we never have met.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Blues wrapped around my head.
His voice was low with pain.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Baby, please come home.
Got to have done some evil deed.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
When you go your way and I go mine.
It don't matter anyhow.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
By the jealousy of others around her.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
I can walk anytime around the block.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
You got it, baby.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Crumble into one another.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
High society, notoriety.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
I couldn't find any.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
That's really and truly an American.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Last radio is playing.
Girls like birds fly away.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Remember, before you come, at least please first telephone.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.

With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
To reach of your rattling drums.

I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.

So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.

Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
There's a guy I gotta see.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Everything inside is made of stone.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.

To anything I might've tried.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.

Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.

He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
In fond memory appear.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
The words that her lover had said.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
He never did know what it was all about.
And then unto eternity.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
You always got more than enough rope.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
It's just the old American way.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
And I need you, ah.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
I just can't see through it anymore.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
For your times, they are a-changing.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
While evening slips away.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
I'm sad and lonely too.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I didn't realize how young you were.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
I did not do it knowingly.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Where I was born and partly raised.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
Even before you came in the door.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
The time and the place that we'd part.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Greenwich Village.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
That old ship was a-going down.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
But I ain't got Corrina.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Baby, baby.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Because everybody must get stoned.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
If it just don't make me hurts.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
You're gonna need my help someday.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Said it was a bad dream.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Waiting on my burying ground.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
I finally got a job in New York town.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
She saw her father's body broken.
Dollar a day's worth.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Going through all these things twice.
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom".
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
I don't know.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Saying wants company.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
Never will want for money.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
So many people I never saw in my life.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
I'll remember you.
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot".
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Ever since we've been apart.
When my memory is not so short.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
The hour when the ship comes in.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
In this concrete world full of souls.
My face you'll never see no more.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
To know which way the wind blows.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
He's always on trial for just being born.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
I always thought that he was well.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
My mind is breaking.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Never been so easy or so slow.
Yes, tell me.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
I would only let you down.
I seen a man.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Humility, simplicity.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
68, but says she's 24.
And gives it to me for a song.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
You to me were the best.
I never saw the man again.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
You may not see me tomorrow.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
I hope you're ready.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
A foreign sound to your ear.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
She said she would always stay.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Some place so high above the wall.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
All my connections too.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
If you throw it all away.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
I can't shoot them anymore.
You can say I didn't give to you.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Take it on down to give me grow.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
It hurts me, too.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Hope that it don't sleet.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Baby, let me follow you down.
But my heart just won't give in.
Precious memories flood my soul.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Just crying out that he was framed.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
He's got his mother's eyes.
And each one I've never seen again.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Evidently she won't.
You give something up for everything you gain.
'Cause I don't think about it.
You can make it too.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
If you just let me follow you down.
Without ideals or violence.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
After losing every battle.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
"Don't trill no news on me.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
68, but says he's 24.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
The sooner you can go.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
It'll never do, somehow.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Everything is broken.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
My baby told me I would have to go.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
But mine was a little different, you see.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
What some people are gonna do for money.
I's looking around just to see myself.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
I know you always say that you agree.
But he sure left here in style.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
I took some comfort there.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
I just can't keep from crying.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
It only brings me sorrow.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
That brave and devoted band.
And light on your right knee.
I had so little time to fail.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
And I need you, yeah.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
And get something quick to eat.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Come on, baby...
We may not make it through the night.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Figuring a way to get back home.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
Mortality, reality.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Tried to create a next world war.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Means another poor boy is underground.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Well, I'm just thumping.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Hmm.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
When I'm alone with you.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
Than people who are most content.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Someone who will die for you and more.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
Kisses she gave him three.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
And relive my dreams.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Trying to create a next world war.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
And I want you to be that woman.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
And the morning will be breaking.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I'm falling in love with you.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
To hold me in your arms.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
Some place so high above this wall.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
Someone's watching over you.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
You were always so close and still within reach.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
His enemies say he's on their land.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Got ice water in my veins.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Ever since I seen her smile.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Buildings going up to the sky.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
Billy, you been running for so long.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
On the caboose of the train.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
My love, she speaks softly.
While my conscience explodes.
That I really did try to get close to you.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
And the night blows rainy.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
And watch the parking meters.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
And she had left him to die in there.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
Living down Sonora way.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
What's real and what is not.
With an iron chain around his neck.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Is what this thing here is for.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And all your raging glory.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Magic in a magical land.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
Oh, her darling love she found.
And rivers that ran through every day.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
For the times, they are a-changing.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Down to New Orleans.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Go lightly on the ground.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
A true love of mine.
The night will soon be gone.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
Is tearing up your mind.
It would go up against every rule.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
They both rode off together.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
You break your promise all over the place.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
In the border-towns of despair.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Sweet lady.
That which is not permanent don't last.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Foundationed deep somehow.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
And the mailbox is locked.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
And no time to think.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
She murdered mortal he.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
But it was more than I could do.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders. I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
On this new morning with you.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
Your voice was all that I heard.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
Her fond face pale with woe.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
And they gotta cut something.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Just like so many times before.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
Valentines can't buy her.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
To keep her from the howling winds.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
To be alone with you.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
Bid farewell forever.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Wants to get it paid off.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
I needed somebody to talk to.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
Every link was Jesus's name.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Nobility, humility.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
You're drifting too far from shore.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
That must be what it's all about.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
I just can't do what I done before.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
Orders from the D.A.
"And light on my right knee.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Serve somebody:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Man is opposed to fair play:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Till I come into New York town:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
But there's one promise, darling:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
His epitaph plain:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue:
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Crumble into one another;
Make promises by the hour;
Had to be held down by big police;
About everybody that was hanging out;
All lies and jest;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Some speak of the future;
I find complete love;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Everybody that was hanging out;
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
Have they missed you?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Must everybody bow?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
But who did I see but the one I love?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Why would I want to take your life?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And how does it feel?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
How could they let you go?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
How many more can they afford?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Oh, so why not you and me?
How can I live for You?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Are you ready?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Oh, where are you tonight?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
But, something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
How much poison did they inhale?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Where did you lose your wings?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Baby, can I come home with you?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
But am I still dreaming yet?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
How many more without any reward?
The love that a stranger might receive?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
That too many people have died?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Am I still dreaming yet?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
For all these earthly things?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Baby, can't you tell?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Where did you hide your halo?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Can I come home with you?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
When he's standing in front of you?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Why and what's the reason for?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Before you call him a man?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Gal, where you been so long?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
And one deserving of affection?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Does anyone even try?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Can you get back in?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
To love and follow His direction?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Who killed Davey Moore?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
What can I do for You?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How's everything in heaven?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Just what in the world has come over you?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Has anybody seen my love?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
What good am I?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Of everything you see?
Don't you remember making baby love?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Just like a rolling stone?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
By golly, what more can I say?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
What's wrong with you this time?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Like a rolling stone?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
What would life be?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
How does it feel?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
How many compared to yesterday?
When did you leave heaven?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Before he can hear people cry?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Before he can see the sky?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Too many people have died?
Before they're forever banned?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Am I ready?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
What else can a poor boy do?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Before they're allowed to be free?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
What can I give to You?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Across the swamp of time?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Who's gonna let it roll?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
How could they ever mistake you?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Across the swooping plain?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
You have to pay to get outta
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
You used––be so proud
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And that even the nobles get properly handled
We live in a political world
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
And your trouble is you know it too good
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
I want you, baby, just to understand
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
"Equality". I spoke the word
Now you don't seem so proud
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
I'll always thank the Lord
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
So I'll make my stand
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
How many times can a man turn his head
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Standing on the water, casting your bread
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
But something has changed
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
She let go of my hand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
All the sweethearts you can hold
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
And things would be different the next time we wed
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Things would be different the next time we wed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
By no special friend
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
He wagged his tail and shook his head
You used to be so amused
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Many times I've often prayed
Just what you had in mind
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
They took a clean-cut kid
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I still can remember the way that you smiled
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
I've been walking around
For what you sold that's not been received
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And into the path you are hurled
Now, whenever I get up and
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
But she ain't gonna find the road
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Silvio, silver and gold
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
To see him obviously framed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Then came the warning that was before the flood
I run right home and I went to bed
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Either from the mountains of Madrid
But all that suffering was not to be compared
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Maybe someday you will understand
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
He was a clean-cut kid
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Nothing was delivered
But now something has changed
Now, a very great man once said
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Now you don't act so––so proud
I will not go down under the ground
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
I thought that it was well-understood
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Somebody seen him hanging around
Its iron claws attached
I live in another world
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
While some, on principles baptized
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Roving gambler, he was very bored
As I stand upon the sand
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
The changes I was going through can't even be used
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
And those whom doom and death had spared
You try so hard, but you don't understand
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
There ain't nothing in this world
It's something you did
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
And then you told me later as I apologized
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Leaving men wholly, totally free
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Among the lovely people living free
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
And I ain't complaining none
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Just what you will say when you get home
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
What good am I then to others and me
We see this empty cage now corrode
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
You know, it's not even safe no more
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Most of the time I can't even be sure
All I feel is heat and flame
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
But I feel nothing for their game
I do declare
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
What's probably got you baffled more
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
I been wondering all about me
So, I called up the operator of time
Looking at hands for the lines that were
See the primitive wallflower freeze
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
There were times when I was so lonesome
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
I rode with him in a taxi once
Full of hope and desire
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Hunger pays a heavy price
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
With all memory and fate
I am homeless, come and take me
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
The cause was there before we came
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
You said you'd never compromise
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Up into some paradise
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
It's getting dark, too dark to see
I don't even notice she gone
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I can survive and I can endure
Maybe someday you will look back and see
She plunged him into well water where
From the start by the rule
When the rain is blowing in your face
And never sat once at the head of the table
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
You say you're looking for someone
"It's only you that he does crave
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Why wait any longer for the one you love
You into thinking you're the one
From the Golden Gate Bridge
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
So up she picked her babies three
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Lies that life is black-and-white
I'm ready for to fade
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Should I put them by your gate
While them that defend what they cannot see
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
And her silver-studded phantom cause
If dogs run free, why not me
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
As he rises to fame
You just pick anyone
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
That she's the same one
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
From all the plans they do pursue
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Little did I realize
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
How was I to know you'd be the one
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
And you see why it's so unique to be
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Says it's closing time
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Remember me to the one who lives there
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Knows there's no success like failure
But the dark does die
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Just pick anyone
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
But I can get another one
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
A girl who would murder her own, true love
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
And plenty time for good romance
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
And I would send a message
Better stay away from those
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
If dogs run free, why not we
She knows there's no success like failure
So I look like a walking mountain range
It's all new to me
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
When Reilly's daughter got a message
To give the special one you seek a chance
And the Negro's name
They say don't come back no more
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
To show you something you seen before
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
It'll be with me unto the grave
She been gone
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Should I leave them by your gate
So I remember every face
You could almost think that you're seeing double
How many ears must one man have
On the rising curve
You're not free to belong to me
He'll see by his grave
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
When I'm all alone
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
And suddenly there appeared before me
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
The man the authorities came to blame
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
If dogs run free, then what must be
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And that is that one must always flush out his house
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Where I could watch her waltz for free
A bed that is never mine
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
And I'm just the same as anyone else
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
What about that millionaire
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Limited in sex they dare
But I can't say I sympathize
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Breaking hearts up and down the line
You cut to the core
When the roses fade
Waiting to find out what price
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
The crashing waves roll over me
At dawn my lover comes to me
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Mona tried to tell me
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Feel to moan, but unlike before
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Taking care of somebody nice
Though its shadow's metal badge
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Well, it's all new to me
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Remember me to one who lives there
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And there's no telling who that it's naming
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
The order is rapidly fading
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
If I was with her too long
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
'Cause the battle outside raging
You left me standing in the doorway crying
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
It's not a bad way to make a living
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Early in the morning, early in the morning
For your weary toes to be touching
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Where the time and the tempo drag
There's nothing in here moving
She rode by night and came by morning
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
They're drinking up and walking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
But then a whistle will be blowing
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
For your weary toes to be a-touching
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
The battle outside raging
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Deceived me into thinking
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
The order is a-rapidly fading
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Look out, the saints are coming through
You go north and you go south
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Then she told us how times were tough
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I have fallen far beneath
And how I know I'll make it through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Her voice once and talk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
Well, there ain't no going back
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
But they caught him and they brought him back
You turn around to take a final peek
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
The man in me will do nearly any task
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
I wish she'd unlock
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Shoot in the back
Make everything from toy guns that spark
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
How does it feel
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Then why don't she tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
How many seas must a white dove sail
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
I chased me a woman up the hill
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Muttering small talk at the wall
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Ring bell, hard to tell
And if my love is real
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
A girl by the whirlpool
They ask me how I feel
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Ring bar, hard to tell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
How many seas must the white dove sail
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Oh, how does it feel
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
He's sure got a lot of gall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
But among the dead that were left on the hill
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
A-how does it feel
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
All and all can only fall
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
As the last fire-truck from hell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
He's taught in his school
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Two eyes took the aim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
So, one morning when the sun was warm
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
"For you cannot relive them
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And remain as I am
But I can hear another drum
You better not chew gum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
But it's hard to think on
In ceremonies of the horsemen
He got that fortress on the mountain
To remember the times when I was your only man
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
You take just like a woman
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Uncle Rat went running downtown
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
That long, black train is pulling down
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And the smell of their roses does not remain
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
But the post office has been stolen
But the second mother was with the seventh son
From heights that they could not gain
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
As you sit on the box you keep him in
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
My love, she's like some raven
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Their religion of the little ten women
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
In the pigpen
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
The ones that jump on the wagon
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
"Not me," said the gambling man
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
But all their daughters put me down
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
I don't even care if I ever see her again
And there's no exit in any direction
How many roads must a man walk down
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Out of the shower comes a football man
And the corner sign
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
For the loser now might be later to win
And she wakes just like a woman
Well, you fake just like a woman
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Have died in battle or in vain
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
A-she takes just like a woman
Trying to get a lead on
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
She said that all the railroad men
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
I figure maybe we're even
Yes, and someone must explain
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
And she aches just like a woman
Advertising signs that con
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Guns and clubs followed him down
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Why did you trade heaven
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Darkness at the break of noon
Must meet the dawn
I'll be waiting at the station
Please don't let on that you knew me when
But I swear I see my reflection
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
You need something to make it known
Yet I swear I see my reflection
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Well, I'm hanging on
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
All their daughters put me down
The next morning she had awoken
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
You don't need a weatherman
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
To my knowledge there's just one man
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
That long, black train is pulling on down
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
How can the life of such a man
For the loser now will be later to win
And all their daughters put me down
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Somebody new to beat on
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
She got such a sweet disposition
She takes just like a woman
And you ache a-just like a woman
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Suicide remarks are torn
But me, I expected it to happen
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Every place I wanna go
There is a place you go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
All I'd like you to do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
There's nothing you can say or do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
It's very nice to stay a week or two
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Silvio, I gotta go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
All I really wanna do
The man in the coon-skin cap
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
What good am I while you softly weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
How many times must a man look up
Aladdin and his lamp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Man in the coon-skin cap
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
I walked down there and ended up
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
The face of God will appear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
I say, "Why you say that for
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
All you boys better run for cover
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Who came here from Cuba's door
The wind howls like a hammer
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
I don't have to go far
You heard me saying a prayer for
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
At any moment you could go under
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
For I am married to a house carpenter
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Alone you stand with nobody near
Still I've always kind of missed her
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
The lover who has just walked out your door
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
So, don't fear if you hear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
When you whispered in my ear
And I don't even think about her
For all eternity I think I will remember
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
I could feel a whole lot better
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
She took him by his long, yellow hair
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Still I say her love-words over
In one I was running and in another
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
But morning is clear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I close my eyes and I wonder
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Never no more do I wonder
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
When only you are near
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Six-time users
Don't follow leaders
Romantic facts of musketeers
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Well, the ragman draws circles
And I try to harmonize with songs
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And the princess and the prince discuss
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
The cowboy angel rides
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And inside it with the people made of molasses
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
People on the platforms
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
To memorizing politics
You never turned around to see the frowns
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
You know that he has no intentions
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
You can fall down on your knees
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
True love can make a blade of grass
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
You been hurt so many times
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
They whisper in the wings
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I let it slip gladly to my friends
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
I try to tell it like it is
When your mother sends back all your invitations
To sharpen the senses
Don't wear sandals
And, though the masters make the rules
At times I think there are no words
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Her window's wide open, African trees
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Six-time losers
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
He's not selling any alibis
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
What good am I if I say foolish things
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
I'd gladly confess
How many deaths will it take till he knows
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Glide across the lonely years
Wants eleven dollar bills
But still remains
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
And so Patty calls the cops
You should be made to wear earphones
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
And then complains
But, though the masters make the rules
Seven days
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
As friends and other strangers
On the back of the fish truck that loads
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
With a fantastic collection of stamps
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Girl by the whirlpool's
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
People carry roses
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Thinking of a series of dreams
Good and bad, I define these terms
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
That it's you and no one else that owns
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And your father, to your sister he explains
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
With a big bouquet of the roses
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
We living in times when men commit crimes
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Now, you must provide some answers
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
To the cutting of fences
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
I'm gonna let you pass
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Statues made of matchsticks
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And the poor white remains
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
And tells me of her dreams
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And I, in my armor, turning about
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
You don't forget
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
So he never thinks straight
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Keep me set apart
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And, since my feet are now fast
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
To hold each other tight
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
But, if the arrow is straight
Plants in the bed, but
And the first one now will later be last
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Everything is always right
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
The slow one now will later be fast
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Every new messenger bringing evil report
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
He built a fire on Main Street
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Oh, everybody's got to eat
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
That might be all that you got
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
There's some people that
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
No one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
You're gonna get hit
Like a corkscrew to my heart
You're hearing my heart beat
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Keep it in your mind and not forget
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
I think that it's best
Johnny's in the basement
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Everyone still talks about
I got into the driver's seat
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Someday, everything is gonna be different
It don't take too long to find out
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
By the way, that's a cute hat
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Wait for the morning light
In the stillness of the midnight
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
You are there in the flickering light
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
In the precious winds they rot
Without any doubt
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
You used to laugh–make fun about
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
How many years can some people exist
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
I'm on the pavement
The slowest now will later be fast
One more night I will wait for the light
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
She seems too far out
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
And no one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
How many years can a mountain exist
One more night the moon is shining bright
With your pockets well protected at last
I soon get some rest
He really wasn't where it's at
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Well, I finally started thinking straight
You used to laugh about
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Talking that the heat put
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
We can hold up a toast if we meet
They tell me revenge is sweet
They tell me to be discreet
To be alone with you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
I'll remember you
It's just crazy being here with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I can be just like you
To protect you and defend you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Sooner or later one of us must know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
I'd sure like to know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Don't it always go to show
But sooner or later one of us must know
Don't it always a-go to show
With only you in view
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Well, I'd sure like to know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
He been living there three years now
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
It only goes to show
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Yes, I'd sure like to know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
The only one I know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
From phony jealousy
And for His love they took His life away
My ears hear a symphony
But I can't deny
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
To those condemned to act accordingly
That I was just a puppet in a play
And the only tune my guitar could play
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
She puts it to me plain as day
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
For them that think death's honesty
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
The same thing I would want today
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Someone to get you flowers constantly
So I run down most hurriedly
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
And I'm leaving every day to run away
And the ladies treat me kindly
He made the bells of freedom ring today
I did not do it harmfully
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
We banged the drum slowly
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
For them that must obey authority
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Don't you tell Henry
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
A cock is crowing far away
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
So, I'm walking down your highway
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Or if you just want some company
Went to the doctor the very next day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
She smiles, walks the other way
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Maggie says that many say
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Spouted out that liberty
And it's up to you to say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
She starts to speak, but he walks away
And that which you've given me today
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
No, you'll not now or no other day
If I don't take the chance to try
Well, I saw it advertised one day
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Though I'd never say
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
For them that think death––death's honesty
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
My mind weaves a symphony
That I done it the way
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
But I wish there was something you would do or say
The Spanish-American War had its day
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
But you can never steal away
Is worth more than I could pay
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
I send you all my money
She knocked upon it anyway
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
So they took him to the infirmary
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
There oughtta be a law against you coming around –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Havana–gee–
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Private reasons – great or small –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Ten thousand miles or more –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Leave all the children home –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Remember me to one who lives there –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
How badly they were shocked –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
I'm sure it was not three –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Hang out the whole next day –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
To know where you are –
You should be made to be wearing a telephone –
I a-hope you can hear––
As suicide remarks are torn –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
That can win what's a-never been won –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
I long to hold you in the night –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
What you're gonna say when you get home –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I hope that you can hear––
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Disconnect these cables––
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Indians camp along her border –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Oh, my–
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Haven't seen her since that night –
First degree and second degree –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Hava–na–
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
You will not hear a laugh –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Havanagee–luh–
Whispering your secret emotion –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I got no idea what I want –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Ha–va–
It can't be this way everywhere –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
