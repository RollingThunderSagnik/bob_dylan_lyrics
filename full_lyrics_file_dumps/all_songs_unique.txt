I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
I got the freight train blues!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Them Reds did it!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!

Oh!
You're a liar!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Play that guitar now!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
How they ever flood my soul!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
It was the mailman!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Alright!
Dignity never been photographed!
Good God!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Woo!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Woo-hoo!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, yeah!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Start over!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
My God, they killed Him!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Yeah, man!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Hootenanny television!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Well!
So long, New York!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
I've got the freight train blues!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Yes, come out your window!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
He punched me out!
Goodnight!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I wanna be yours!
Oh, yeah!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Dance!
[incoherent] on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
They got away!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
They was all over!
Alright, now!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
She's insane!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Play fucking loud!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Oh, no!
Betty Ross!
You must think I'm crazy!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Lordy, Lord!
She takes just like a woman - yes!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
I ain't different than anyone!
I've got a million friends!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Thank you!
Take me down to California, baby!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Howdy, East Orange!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
I'm in love with you!
Yippee!
Pressing on - oh, yes, I am!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
I'll bring back my lady."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
I can't find my knees."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
They look as dark as night."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Where you and I will unite."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
And punched my cigarette."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Country'll grow."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
We'll both go off together."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
But I know what you want."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Will mourn for your return."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
"I've had too much of your company,"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
We want folksingers here."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
You must know about my debutante."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
But we were tangled up in blue."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
I'll apply them all to thee."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
We'll both go home together."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Tangled up in blue."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
And hung on a willow tree."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
And it's all for the love of thee."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
God said, "On Highway 61."
"That way down Highway 61."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
So write to her tenderly."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
You can't blame me at all."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
And pretend that you never have met."
I'll see her soon, I know."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
You can't blame us at all."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
And have it on Highway 61."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
He said, "Tell me about it."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
It's all for the love of thee."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
And keep him good company."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
"Is it easy to forget?"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
I didn't see you around."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
I love far better than thee."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
You and I'll never know."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Have it on Highway 61."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
I'll endow them onto thee."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
I would want again tomorrow."
That you must always first forgive them."
Come flowing down so free?"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
They look as white as snow."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
People carry roses,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Saved,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Said I'm pressing on,
If you can't quit your sinning,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
It's rising up above my head,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Most of the time it's well understood,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Is used, it is plain,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
God knows it's outta sight,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
That the laws are with him,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Adios, mi corazon,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
Don't tie no bows,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
True love of mine,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Father of black, father of white,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Tell me that you love me only,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
You have given me eyes to see,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
All the tired horses in the sun,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
The carpet too is moving under you,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Stone you and say good luck,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
I got a bird that whistles,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Strangers all give me the news,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
And I--I walk out on my own,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
People going down to the ground,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
It was from her ship sailing,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
I try my best to be like I am,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Don't you tell Henry,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
And I got those worried blues,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
You want watered-down love,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
"Not I," said the referee,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
You need something to open your eyes,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
On the stone that remains,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Wasn't making any great connection,
I wish tonight were here,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Heart of mine, be still,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
This world is ruled by violence,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
But he's the property of Jesus,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Heart of mine, go back home,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
I thank the Lord,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
I rambled out of New York town,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Don't wear sandals,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
God knows there's a purpose,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
A question in your nerves is lit,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Loyalty, unity,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Whether you are right or wrong,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Had no one to go my bail,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Since you've been gone,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
One by one they follow the sun,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
I need a shot of love,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
I can finish this alone, honey,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Wintertime in New York town,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Go down to the river, babe,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Well, get sick, get well,
Never needed to call you my whore,
My woman needs it every day,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
You're beautiful beyond words,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I know I can't win,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
It could even be like a myth,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
I just don't know what to do,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
I could have left this town by noon,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
In the turning of twilight,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
It hurts me, too,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
It's like I ain't here,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Silhouetted by the sea,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
How many a year has passed and gone,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
To stay closer than any friend,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Far away and over the wall,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
May you stay forever young,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Never did feel this way before,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
My arms and legs were broken,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Precious angel under the sun,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
And the sooner you come up with them,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
So, never leave me lonely,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Oh, Angelina,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Father of day, father of night,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
If I didn't have to guess,
But evidently she don't,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
They tell me every man must fall,
But I've been hanging on,
Oh, watered-down love,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Badge out, laid off,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Fare thee well but for a while,
To keep up his hate,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Joey, Joey,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Like a complete unknown,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Well, I'm pressing on,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
She never does me wrong,
If today was not a crooked highway,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
And the table's full and overflowed,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
They say that every man must fall,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Madams light the candles,
Is looking for a new fool,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Down boulevards of broken cars,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Looking for a new fool,
Thieving in the alley,
Get back, write Braille,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
It always has hit me from below,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
You have given everything to me,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
I once held her in my arms,
God knows how to make it flow,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Watching the river flow,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
You follow, find yourself at war,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
As his youth now unfolds,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Well, I can't understand,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
And, although that we're single and free,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
This situation can only get rougher,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
They say every man need protection,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Look who's back in town,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
I can see the turning of the key,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
One summer's day he came passing by,
In the hills of mystery,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Silvio, I gotta go,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I got my mind made up,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
You have laid down Your life for me,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
You'll be doing society a favor,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
A handle hid out in the dark,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Can't find what I need,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
The one we can see and can feel,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I'm going out of my mind,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
But I know that he don't talk,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
He been around the world and back again,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Broken hands on broken plows,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Watch the river flow,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Without a dream in my heart,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
It always means so much,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
All them prophets good and gone,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
And not going through any great extreme,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Mercury, gravity,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Thinking about the government,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
When I was in Missouri,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
He is centuries old,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Circled by the circus sands,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
I wish I a-was a magician,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I couldn't see where we were going,
And she makes love just like a woman,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
You gotta look some other place,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
A man named Martin Luther King,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
You were striped, you were plain,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
You will be alright, girl,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
But it ain't me, babe,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
God knows that, when you see it,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
And give him back the time he's done,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
They run a brick and tile company,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
The country doctor rambles,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Want you so bad,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Try to be a success,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
They--they show me to the door,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Private reasons, great or small,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
It's really something,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
Want you,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
They say every man must need protection,
They keep it all hid,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Gonna serve somebody,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
If you throw it all away,
Trust yourself,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Don't let her hear,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Into my own parade,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
I bless the day I found you,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
And the whole world is on your case,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Ooh, watered-down love,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
You always responded when I needed your help,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
I shall be released,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
I had a dream about you, baby,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Look away, you rolling river,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Try hard, get barred,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Searching high, searching low,
Hmm, I can make it through,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Aim well, my little one,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
You could look at it and weep,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
A hand set the spark,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Look out, kid,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
In the end,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
And, if I see the day,
I'm leaving today,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Come on, come on, stick together,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Nothing too very scientific,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
As human gods aim for their mark,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
And you make love just like a woman,
God knows you've got to weep,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Laying low,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
The country music station plays soft,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
If ever I prove false to you,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Going,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
It's people's games you got to dodge,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
So unknown,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
And I'm so glad,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Don't let yourself stumble,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Well, well, well,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
And I'm just like that bird,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Some things are too hot to touch,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
They must bust in early May,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Analyze you, categorize you,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Corrina, Corrina,
Precious memories, how they linger,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
For she ain't the same,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Searching everywhere I know,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Paradise, sacrifice,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
I can change, I swear,
Far away in the stormy night,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
You need something to open up a new door,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Over your senses you have no control,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
You and me, we had completeness,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
You stole her love from me one day,
You made it there somehow,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Without ideals or violence,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
How he died nobody can say,
But I'm saved,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
To be--direction home,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Equality, liberty,
They don't believe in mercy,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Face full of black soot,
When I seen him lose control,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
If she ain't feeling well,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Love that's pure no accident,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Looking 'bout the government,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
God sees it all unfold,
To have--be on your own,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
When there is no more,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
He's not selling any alibis,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
To be one your own,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
But it ain't him to blame,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Father who build the mountain so high,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
And I'm in the shade,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
I want you so bad,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
She once was a true love of mine,
One by one until there were none,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Who could they get to carry you,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Bring the wife and family,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
May be living in another country under another name,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Just like I did before,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Each one playing a horn,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
You were snow, you were rain,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
All the silver, all the gold,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
By the night and been to some place new,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
God knows everything,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
I got those worried blues,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
But the time ain't tall,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
One by one they followed the sun,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
I just say no thanks,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
In the shadows of moonlight,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Don't let me change my heart,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
But he can't be blamed,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
I should have left this town this morning,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Don't try No Doz,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Just to know that you are near,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Ever since I been a child,
At the close of the day,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
China doll, alcohol,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
We live in a political world,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
And, though the line is cut,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Three angels up above the street,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
And pretend that we never have touched,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
I can make it through,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
And to come every time you call,
I fell down to my bended knees,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Now you don't talk so loud,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
That long, black train is pulling down,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
A true love of mine,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
And may you stay forever young,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
With no direction home,
To be without a home,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
You even make love just like a woman,
They walk among the stately trees,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
I can't be good, baby,
At ships with tattooed sails,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
For the politician's gain,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
I'd be sad and blue,
The man in the trench-coat,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
I just keep pressing on,
But something has changed,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
She'll surely turn to white,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
New morning,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
I been good,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Eh, singing just for you,
Don't let me drift too far,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Well, I don't mind dying,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Father of night, father of day,
A thousand miles from home,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
It all seemed so well-timed,
No, nothing was delivered,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Don't let her see where you're going,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Don't wanna be a bum,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
But, deep inside my heart,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
In the instant that I preach,
A complete unknown,
If you'd see me this way,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Went back home to the yard,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Someone to open each and every door,
Bringing me all of your charms,
And you take just like a woman,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
You got something better,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Well, I'm so glad,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Now, won't you tell me true,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
The human mind can only stand so much,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Got my mind made up,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
"Come along and take a trip,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
The Second World War came to an end,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
No direction home,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Just like a rolling stone,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
That can do what's never been done,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
You say my kisses are not like his,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
My limbs are shaking,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
It's not aimed at anyone,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
And there's two white horses following me,
Mixing up the medicine,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
I had no one for to go my bail,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
And your streets are getting empty,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
But I'm pressing on,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
A man with a badge skips by,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
The night passed away so quickly,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
You married young just like your ma,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I've been saved - well, alright,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
The sky too is folding under you,
Oh, see what you can do,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Without your sweet love,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Read books, repeat quotations,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
I'd only have to stay,
But you try with your whole soul,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Stripping away at it all,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Don't let yourself fall,
I would not feel so all alone,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
As the present now will later be past,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Ain't no going back,
The sky too is folding over you,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
And also by his feet,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
They say every distance is not near,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Where the neon madmen climb,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I'm so glad,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
While riding on a train going west,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Dream about you, baby,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Stay away from the train line,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
In the lonely night,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
But the bottles are done,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Drag you down or drain you down,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
You can raise up your right hand,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Precious father, loving mother,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
That must be what it's all about,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
For her to arrive,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I went out last night to take a little round,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I got a wife and five little children,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
And it's like I ain't here,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Don't let her know,
But, if I can save you any time,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Watered-down love,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
God knows you ain't pretty,
See her in that very tight skirt,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Too noble to neglect,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Or disgrace you or displace you,
The beat is pumping,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
For his age he is wise,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Two by two they step in the dark,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
She said she would never forget,
Human gods aim for their mark,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
And gathering storms may arise,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
The path you've endured has been rough,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Broken idols, broken heads,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
May be an actor in a plot,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
The day would surely have to break,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I found my world, found my world in you,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
For something that he never done,
See you fly or watch you die,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
A dream about you, baby,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Baby, please stop crying,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Hold me, baby, be near,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Oxford Town around the bend,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
I been riding the midnight train,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
We've killed each one,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
While paupers change possessions,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
All you can do is do what you must,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
You had enough of hatred,
To know how much I really care,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Staying far behind without you,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
And forget my pride,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
And on the highway of regret,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
In his anger and his shame,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
My existence led by confusion boats,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
To a solid rock,
Not the end, not the end,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
She's opened up a happy home,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Waiting for the trains,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
From their fates try to resign,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I have no one to meet,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
God knows it's a struggle,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Read books and repeat quotations,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Carved next to his name,
Make you spin or do you in,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
It was you who came right through,
I'm never, never far from home,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
He won't do nothing to you,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
And ye shall be a-changed,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
But, if I will save you the time,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
I don't care if you feel like me,
To hang and to lynch,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
I want you,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Memory, ecstasy,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
You better chew gum,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
He got that soft, silky skin,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Don't steal, don't lift,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
And, on their promises of paradise,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Far away from it all,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
God knows it's a crime,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Living in the land of Nod,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
She said she would always stay,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Thank You, Lord,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
To be so useless and all,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
We'll fly the night away,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Poor boy dressed in black,
By users, cheaters,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
So many roads, so much at stake,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
In the ruins of your balcony,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Too serious to fool,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Where I will always be renewed,
Like as not, it's better so,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
You don't have to feed me,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
Up and down the block,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
I try my best to be just like I am,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
That fellow who never blushes,
All I really wanna do,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
The night would see me wide awake,
Beating for the dead that rise,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Puffing on a big cigar,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Light yourself a candle,
If you must cling to someone,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
But now morning is clear,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Need a woman all the time,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
I had so much left to do,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
I'm gonna let you pass,
You got to serve somebody,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Trouble,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
To be on your own,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Front door shut, back door too,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
With the juice running down my leg,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
How he died nobody could say,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I got the worried blues,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Someone to close his heart,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
God knows there's a heaven,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
The light I never knowed,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
But, it ain't me, babe,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
And she aches just like a woman,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
I can't understand,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
But, to remain as friends,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Well, I been gambling so long,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Winter would have no spring,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Using every angle under the sun,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Like a rolling stone,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
God don't call it treason,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I ain't looking to block you up,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
More people kept a-piling on,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
And I'm back in the rain,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
God knows it's fragile,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Carry the New York Times,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Is it really any wonder,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Each time we meet, love,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
He's the property of Jesus,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Tell her not to worry,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
God knows there's a chance,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
A million faces at my feet,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Got me a secret membership card,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
You find God in the church of your choice,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
You have explained every mystery,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
I threw it all away,
But you were gambling for support,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Don't follow leaders,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Yesterday is just a memory,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
When the night comes falling,
My senses have been stripped,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Alright, I'm so glad,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
She got great big hind legs,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
I been good while I been waiting,
Out to the windy beach,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
Only one thing I did wrong,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Poor boy never say die,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I'll go see them come down my way,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Don't ever try to change me,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
I got two white horses following me,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Vanished from my hand,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
And to come each time you call,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Automobile coming into style,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
And the point is slick,
And, if I can save you any time,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
To gather flowers constantly,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Grandpa died last week,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
And you know I could never be your own,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Serve somebody,
To your tambourine in time,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
In another I witnessed a crime,
In the image of someone you used to know,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Don't let her know that you love her,
By losers, cheaters,
She would have married me,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
And, if anybody asks me,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
I'd already gone the distance,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Says he's got a bad cough,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
They say everything can be replaced,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
If'n you don't know by now,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Like you never did before,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
I want my arms around you,
But I will be back, I will survive,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Speaking to some French girl,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
With what your fate is going to be,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I don't wanna fake you out,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
I march in the parade of liberty,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
When she lays upon the grass,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
God knows there's a river,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
It don't matter what you did,
My woman's never sitting at home,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
But you're doing it again,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
You can run down to the desert,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
The only son of God Almighty,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
To be alone with you,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
If anything is gonna sell,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Or select you or dissect you,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
And joined the John Birch Society,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
I went down to scrub and rub,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
On this new morning, new morning,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
They say every man must fall,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
To strict party-platform ties,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
And I got the worried blues,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
All that and more and then some,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
True love, they've been without it,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Keep me where you are,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Simplify you, classify you,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
That can do what's a-never been done,
The winter would hold no spring,
I think we better talk this over,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
I'm pledging my time to you,
And think they're fooling you,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Relationships of ownership,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
It was a girl I learned it from,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
By rivers of blindness,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Three by three they're turning the key,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
They pass by so silently,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
And I don't want to drag you down,
With a killer's pride, security,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
First degree and second degree,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Oh, singing just for you,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
The phone's tapped anyway,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
You have given all there is to give,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
In one the surface was frozen,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
The night blows cold and rainy,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
God don't call it wrong,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
But it would not be new,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Like a dog on a chain,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
People talk over situations,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Keep a clean nose,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Day you quit me, baby,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
You came down on me like white thunder,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Get born, keep warm,
You have given me life to live,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
But, if you want me to,
And point away from the past,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
So glad,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Don't matter what you did,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
You'll change your last name, too,
Tell me,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Six months on the chain gang,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
That fired the gun,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
I don't care if you analyze me,
In love and with kindness,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
I got no place left to turn,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
But I would not feel so all alone,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
We take great delight in our own company,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Better jump down the manhole,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
God knows it's terrifying,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
I get my sweet reward,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
He's young and on fire,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
And, when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
You're beautiful to me,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
That you'd have liked me to,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Every brain is civilized,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Pressing on,
It still ain't me, babe,
To be out on your own,
Go melt back in the night,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
That her father was going to hang,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Come all without, come all within,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
They say every man needs protection,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
You to me were true,
You've got to serve somebody,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
There she come, now, down my way,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Without a love of my own,
Resent him to the bone,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
Heart of mine,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Or have done something wrong,
Courage is a thing of the past,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
In the little church a-this side of town,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
My dear, sweet friend,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
To shine in through,
I won't have my nature way,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Well, I may just swear,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Of ancient history,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Give what I got until I got no more,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
If not for you,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
For the wise men and the fools,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
It's a price I have to pay,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
God knows when,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
With his fist in a clinch,
Seven days,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
She'll be coming forth,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I went into the city, into the town,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
People talk of situations,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
They lowered him down as a king,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Going home,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Like some mystery,
You wanna drown love,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
And here I sit so patiently,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Where life and death are memorized,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
My love, she speaks softly,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
The day you quit me, baby,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
There's always someone who understands,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Forever young, forever young,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Hang around the ink-well,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Every head is so dignified,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Father of time and father of dreams,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
And come every time you call,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
I never can go because, you know,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Don't let her see,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
The joint is jumping,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Just don't know what to do,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
That foreign sound in your ear,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
The train leaves at half past ten,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Just remember that death is not the end,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Oh, in somebody's room,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Ye shall be changed,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
It's too bad he had to go,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
So I got those worries blues,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
And she'll be coming forth,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Stand up straight and tall,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Better jump down a manhole,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Well, the way I love that woman,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Name of Martin Luther King,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Friends with you,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Over the hills and far away,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
"Not me," said his manager,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
The air is getting hotter,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Honey, I will meet you there,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
When all will be well,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Why she did go,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Stone you when you are young and able,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Drifting too far from shore,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Never weak, but always strong,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Love don't have any place,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Going, going, gone,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Made before the foundation of the world,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
And it ain't me, babe,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Give you my money, honey,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
And played the fife lowly,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Under the microscope,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Don't let her see that you need her,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
In the great unknown,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
I love you, pretty baby,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Made of silver or of golden,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Go away from my window,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
I've been around this whole country,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Icicles hanging down,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
That five walls cannot hide him,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Advertising signs, they con,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Going, going,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
People are crazy, times are strange,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Eh, see what you can do,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
To protect his white skin,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
To find out if she's talked,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
I'm going down the river,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
You got something I want plenty of,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
It's alright,
She leave by the other and roam,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
The kingdoms of experience,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
You better duck down the alleyway,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Of this I can't say very much,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Don't know what to do without it,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
And furnish me with tape,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Nothing was delivered,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Yet every distance is not near,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
Who will promise never to part,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
God knows it's true,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Just then the order came to charge,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Father of air and father of trees,
In the darkness of my night,
How does it feel,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I'll be on my way,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
For all intended purposes,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
Leave all the children home -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
Whispering your secret emotion -
Haven't seen her since that night -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I long to hold you in the night -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
That's where you belong --
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
Remember me to one who lives there -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Oh, my-
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
You will not hear a laugh -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
It can't be this way everywhere -
I a-hope you can hear--
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
Indians camp along her border -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
I'm sure it was not three -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Ten thousand miles or more -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
They crammed me back into the county jail -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
Disconnect these cables--
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
Turn, turn, turn again -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
I got no idea what I want -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
Ha-va-
As suicide remarks are torn -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
First degree and second degree -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
That can win what's a-never been won -
Private reasons - great or small -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
How badly they were shocked -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
To know where you are -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
Democracy don't rule the world --
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
With no other choice except but for to go -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Thank--
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
Havana-gee-
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
With notions his canoe was laden -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
Havanagee-luh-
Hang out the whole next day -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
Hava-na-
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
I hope that you can hear--
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
My face you'll never see no more.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
You always got more than enough rope.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
He never did know what it was all about.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
Most of the time.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Someone I really could care for.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
So the radio didn't work so well.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Just remember that death is not the end.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
To anything I might've tried.
You know, I loved her just the same.
What's real and what is not.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
That last night I was with.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Or put up against the wall.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
But there's a slow - yeah, there's a slow - there's a slow train coming.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
When out comes a farmer - he musta thought that I was nuts.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Join the army if you fail.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
I got a woman in Jackson - oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
But these to tell what's true.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
You sound like a hillbilly.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Good car to drive, after a war.
Where teardrops fall.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
It would go up against every rule.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Havanageeluh.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
Until my dying-day.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away - we're gonna forget it.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
Hope you're ready.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
I couldn't find any.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Close your eyes, close the door.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
She's in some foreign land.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
All because of the color of his skin.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
The hour when the ship comes in.
In fond memory appear.
She murdered mortal he.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
That's the day you die.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
Father of love and father of rain.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Greenwich Village.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
My love winks, she does not bother.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Suffering like a fool.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Is tearing up your mind.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
I once held her in my arms.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
It's just the same as talking to you.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
And get something quick to eat.
They both rode off together.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
My mind is breaking.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
At the sorority sisters' home.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
Bring that bottle over here.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
I can't fight them anymore.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Rode slowly back again.
And your golden loom.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Tried to create a next world war.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
Remember me to one who lives there.
To which a scoundrel clings.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
When I'm alone with you.
Don't be angry--don't be angry with me should I cry.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
His mama sure was proud of him.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Life don't mean a thing.
Don't look it--like it will anytime soon.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
I've made shoes for everyone - even you - while I still go barefoot.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Know not what the years may hold.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
I once loved a woman - a child, I am told.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
I'm sad and lonely too.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
You'd better get that in your head.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
It'll never do, somehow.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
And every window made of glass.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
And gives it to me for a song.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
"And stay all night with me.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.

There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
You want a watered-down love.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Take me as I am or let me go.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night cafe.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Ever since we've been apart.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
She saw her father's body broken.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
If you throw it all away.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Baby, baby.
Than people who are most content.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
The way you walk and the way you talk - I feel I could almost sing.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Means another poor boy is underground.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
I can't hear you anymore.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
You're my honey.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're-what you are but what you're not.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Leave no stone unturned.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Looking for a new friend.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
And I was brought up by my brother.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
It was all over by a quarter past.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Of every man who put me here.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Watch the parking meters.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Last radio is playing.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
The National Guard stands around the door.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Need that woman straight and true.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Trouble...
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
You're gonna need my help someday.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Nothing done and nothing said.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
At the end of the trail.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
And relive my dreams.
I only saw what they let me see.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
In the dark land of the sun.
Honey, baby.
I don't know.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
And all your raging glory.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
You don't have to worry any more.
"And light on my right knee.
Headed out for the western skies.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
I have heard rumors all over town.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
I never saw the man again.
You'll never see me frown.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Turned on my record player.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Ever since I seen her smile.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Chain you down or be your clown.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
That brave and devoted band.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Six by six...
With an iron chain around his neck.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Got my mind made up.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Friends with you.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Chain you down or bring you down.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Mine alone.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Honey, I want you.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
The sooner you can go.
By that soft and shining sea.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Good as I been to you.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
Even before you came in the door.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
That just struck me kinda funny.
For me to return to or chase.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
And he was a friend of mine.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
And then unto eternity.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
And one day he came passing by.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Epitome, rigidity.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
I had something to protect.
We were the wrong side.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
I want everybody to be free.
She can't find him anywhere.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
I see that stationmaster too.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
You can say I didn't give to you.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
They seem determined to go all the way.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
The words that her lover had said.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
What some people are gonna do for money.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Well, our captain, he is dead - died for a maid.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Come on, baby...
Someone's watching over you.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
68, but says she's 24.
To be alone with you.
Find out something only dead men know.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Lay dead beside him there.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Just you and me.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Honey, I never would have come.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Crying out that he been framed.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
The whole night through.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
To reach of your rattling drums.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Soft as music, light as spring.
But you're never sure why you're here.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
And light on your right knee.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
The country doctor rambles.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
See him at play makes me smile.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Don't remember one thing more.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.

Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
When my memory is not so short.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.

And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.

But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
I hear them semis rolling too.

And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Some place so high above the wall.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.

Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
On the caboose of the train.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
It can't be this way everywhere.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Broken voices on broken phones.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
That keep us so tightly bound.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
And the Santa Fe.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
Everything is gonna be alright.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Mortality, reality.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
But with the country to where you're going.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
Oh, Angelina.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
Baby, two feet from the well.
You're on the bottom.
Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
I didn't feel so cold then.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
But mine was a little different, you see.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
It don't matter anyhow.
Oh, convey herself away.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
A foreign sound to your ear.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
And the night blows rainy.
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Is just equality in school.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
If'n you don't know by now.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
And left me here facing the wall.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
Trying to create a next world war.
I don't believe you.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
To the old folks' home and the college.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Gonna serve somebody.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
If you just let me follow you down.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
So many people I never saw in my life.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Well, I'm just thumping.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
I had so little time to fail.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
To anything I mighta tried.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
You to me were the best.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Everybody that was hanging out.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
I froze right to the bone.
I'm calling you to-I'm calling you to please come home.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
I'll only let you down.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
As the present now will later be past.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
I got nothing left to burn.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
But that's what I am paid to do.
That Johanna's not here.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
The same as my father before him.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
So, darling, you better come through.
To the sin of love's false security.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
You know the song in my heart.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
And I need you, ah.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
But I was raised on the other.
His voice was low with pain.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
I've seen trouble all my days.
I can't shoot them anymore.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Four by four they turn it some more.
At not getting their money's worth.
He could die happily ever after.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
And there's no time to think.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Go find out something only dead men know.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
But the mountains of the past.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
For that's the way I remember her best.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
Throw my mattress out there too.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
We may not make it through the night.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Mama, you been on my mind.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
I can walk anytime around the block.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
They complained in the East - they are paying too high.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
It ain't quite the end.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
And you--you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
A true love of mine.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
If you won't come out your window.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
And time is beginning to crawl.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
All because his face was brown.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
You left me standing out in the cold.
And each one I've never seen again.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
After losing every battle.
But you're not even sure what it is.
In my Cadillac.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
You're the only love I've ever known.
But all I see are dark eyes.
What you'll say when you get home.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Everybody's having them dreams.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Never will want for money.
Please let me ride you home.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Feel further away than ever before.
If not for you.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
In the night the price was paid.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
I'd give anything to be with you.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
That don't apply no more - all from parts of Paris.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
I don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
With my suitcase in my hand.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
About an old man that never done wrong.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Buildings going up to the sky.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
Precious memories flood my soul.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
I been worrying about you, baby.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Hmm.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Have fallen from her curls.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
When you made everybody pay.
To live it you had to explode.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.

When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.

A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.

When the wind blows through the piney wood.
And clouds cover up the ground.

Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.

But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Some place so high above this wall.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Figuring a way to get back home.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
From the little Minnesota town.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
In the border-towns of despair.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
In the palace of the Pope.
While the law looks the other way.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
I'll remember you.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
I'd like to know.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
I can't use it anymore.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Adios, mi corazon.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
I hate bears.
Got ice water in my veins.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Going through all these things twice.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
I'll be your baby tonight.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Oh, yes, they did.
Her fond face pale with woe.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Baby, please come home.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
He's always on trial for just being born.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Serve somebody:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Man is opposed to fair play:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Till I come into New York town:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
His epitaph plain:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
But there's one promise, darling:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Some speak of the future;
I find complete love;
All lies and jest;
So many things that we never will undo;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Make promises by the hour;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Had to be held down by big police;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Crumble into one another;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Everybody that was hanging out;
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
What would life be?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Is it rolling, Bob?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
How many more without any reward?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
When did you leave heaven?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
How many more can they afford?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
How can I live for You?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Why would I want to take your life?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
By golly, what more can I say?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Before it is washed to the sea?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Across the swamp of time?
Like a rolling stone?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
How come you don't send me no regards?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
And how does it feel?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, so why not you and me?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
How does it feel?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Are you the same person that was here before?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Are you ready?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Must everybody bow?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
What can I do for You?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Does he change the course of rivers?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Can you get back in?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Why and what's the reason for?
Has anybody seen my love?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
For all these earthly things?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
Before they're allowed to be free?
To love and follow His direction?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Before he can hear people cry?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Where did you hide your halo?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Before they're forever banned?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
The love that a stranger might receive?
How could they let you go?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Baby, can I come home with you?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What?
Just like a rolling stone?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
What's wrong with you this time?
Baby, can't you tell?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Does anyone even try?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
How could they ever mistake you?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Too many people have died?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
How many compared to yesterday?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
How many paths did they try and fail?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Am I ready?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Ready, George?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
What good am I?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
What can I give to You?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Where did you lose your wings?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Before you call him a man?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
What else can a poor boy do?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Before he can see the sky?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
And one deserving of affection?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
When he's standing in front of you?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But am I still dreaming yet?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
How much poison did they inhale?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Across the swooping plain?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Oh, how could you refuse?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
How's everything in heaven?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Have they missed you?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Who's gonna let it roll?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
That too many people have died?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
How long are we gonna be riding?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Gal, where you been so long?
Poor boy, where you been?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Can I come home with you?
Of everything you see?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
You have to pay to get outta
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
I will not go down under the ground
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
And that even the nobles get properly handled
It's something you did
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Now you don't seem so proud
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
You used--be so proud
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Now you don't act so--so proud
I run right home and I went to bed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Roving gambler, he was very bored
He was a clean-cut kid
And those whom doom and death had spared
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
And your trouble is you know it too good
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
You used to be so amused
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
I thought that it was well-understood
And things would be different the next time we wed
As I stand upon the sand
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
I live in another world
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
Things would be different the next time we wed
By no special friend
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Nothing was delivered
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
To see him obviously framed
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
You try so hard, but you don't understand
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Either from the mountains of Madrid
So I'll make my stand
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
How many times can a man turn his head
I want you, baby, just to understand
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
But something has changed
"Equality". I spoke the word
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Its iron claws attached
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
There ain't nothing in this world
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Just what you had in mind
I've been walking around
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
But she ain't gonna find the road
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
We live in a political world
Now, whenever I get up and
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
All the sweethearts you can hold
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
I still can remember the way that you smiled
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
For what you sold that's not been received
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
And then you told me later as I apologized
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
They took a clean-cut kid
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
I'll always thank the Lord
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
But now something has changed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
While some, on principles baptized
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
She let go of my hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Now, a very great man once said
Many times I've often prayed
Maybe someday you will understand
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
And into the path you are hurled
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Silvio, silver and gold
Somebody seen him hanging around
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
You could almost think that you're seeing double
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
I'm sure you're the one to blame
And the Negro's name
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Lies that life is black-and-white
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
So, I called up the operator of time
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
But I can get another one
To show you something you seen before
The man the authorities came to blame
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Con you into thinking that you're the one
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
You say you're looking for someone
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
If dogs run free, why not me
While them that defend what they cannot see
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
How was I to know you'd be the one
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
But I can't say I sympathize
I been wondering all about me
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Limited in sex they dare
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
It'll be with me unto the grave
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
They say don't come back no more
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
As he rises to fame
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
But the dark does die
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
When I'm all alone
When the rain is blowing in your face
On the rising curve
To give the special one you seek a chance
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And I'm just the same as anyone else
She knows there's no success like failure
We see this empty cage now corrode
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
You're not free to belong to me
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Why wait any longer for the one you love
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
When the roses fade
So I look like a walking mountain range
There were times when I was so lonesome
"It's only you that he does crave
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Says it's closing time
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
She been gone
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
So I remember every face
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
From all the plans they do pursue
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Leaving men wholly, totally free
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
A bed that is never mine
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Well, six white horses that you did promise
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Should I put them by your gate
You smiling through the fence at me
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Should I leave them by your gate
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
And her silver-studded phantom cause
When Reilly's daughter got a message
And suddenly there appeared before me
Remember me to the one who lives there
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
At dawn my lover comes to me
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
What about that millionaire
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
She plunged him into well water where
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
If dogs run free, why not we
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Maybe someday you will look back and see
And never sat once at the head of the table
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
You know, it's not even safe no more
He'll see by his grave
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
I am homeless, come and take me
Waiting to find out what price
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Full of hope and desire
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Up into some paradise
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Knows there's no success like failure
Little did I realize
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
And I ain't complaining none
Well, it's all new to me
Remember me to one who lives there
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Among the lovely people living free
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
With all memory and fate
Just what you will say when you get home
It's getting dark, too dark to see
You said you'd never compromise
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
You just pick anyone
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
And plenty time for good romance
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Better stay away from those
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
The cause was there before we came
And you see why it's so unique to be
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
But I feel nothing for their game
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Mona tried to tell me
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Looking at hands for the lines that were
You cut to the core
Though its shadow's metal badge
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Feel to moan, but unlike before
"Oh, father, you will surely die
You into thinking you're the one
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
And I would send a message
See the primitive wallflower freeze
All I feel is heat and flame
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
It's all new to me
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Taking care of somebody nice
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
So up she picked her babies three
Just pick anyone
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
I'm ready for to fade
Hunger pays a heavy price
I do declare
I don't even notice she gone
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
From the start by the rule
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
How many ears must one man have
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
If dogs run free, then what must be
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
"That I might be gone a long, old time
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
I can survive and I can endure
What's probably got you baffled more
What good am I then to others and me
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
And that is that one must always flush out his house
What you're gonna say when you get home
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
The crashing waves roll over me
That she's the same one
I rode with him in a taxi once
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Beyond here lies nothing
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
For your weary toes to be touching
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
You left me standing in the doorway crying
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
If I was with her too long
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
She rode by night and came by morning
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Where the time and the tempo drag
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Deceived me into thinking
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
There's nothing in here moving
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
But then a whistle will be blowing
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
I know that you know that I know that you show something
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Early in the morning, early in the morning
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
The battle outside raging
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
I can hear their hearts a-beating
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And there's no telling who that it's naming
The order is a-rapidly fading
The order is rapidly fading
They're drinking up and walking
It's not a bad way to make a living
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Well, I set my monkey on the log
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
'Cause the battle outside raging
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I have fallen far beneath
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Look out, the saints are coming through
And how I know I'll make it through
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Then she told us how times were tough
You go north and you go south
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
Her voice once and talk
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
The man in me will do nearly any task
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
You turn around to take a final peek
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Shoot in the back
But they caught him and they brought him back
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
I wish she'd unlock
Well, there ain't no going back
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Make everything from toy guns that spark
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Well, if I die on top of the hill
He's taught in his school
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
How many seas must a white dove sail
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
He's sure got a lot of gall
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
They ask me how I feel
Ring bell, hard to tell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
A-how does it feel
Then why don't she tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Muttering small talk at the wall
As the last fire-truck from hell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Ring bar, hard to tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And if my love is real
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
I chased me a woman up the hill
Soul to soul our shadows roll
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
How does it feel
A girl by the whirlpool
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
But among the dead that were left on the hill
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
How many seas must the white dove sail
Oh, how does it feel
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
All and all can only fall
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
But I can hear another drum
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And remain as I am
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Now, they asked me to read a poem
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
You better not chew gum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
"For you cannot relive them
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Two eyes took the aim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
She takes just like a woman
Out of the shower comes a football man
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Please don't let on that you knew me when
For the loser now will be later to win
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
As you sit on the box you keep him in
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
The ones that jump on the wagon
As they rode him in custody down to the station
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
He got that fortress on the mountain
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
But me, I expected it to happen
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
But I swear I see my reflection
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
The next morning she had awoken
Uncle Rat went running downtown
But the post office has been stolen
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
All their daughters put me down
For the loser now might be later to win
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
But all their daughters put me down
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
You need something to make it known
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
From heights that they could not gain
Their religion of the little ten women
Nothing we can call our own
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
I'll be waiting at the station
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
To my knowledge there's just one man
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Yes, and someone must explain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Why did you trade heaven
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
To remember the times when I was your only man
All lay down their bandanas and complain
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Guns and clubs followed him down
In ceremonies of the horsemen
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
And there's no exit in any direction
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
And you ache a-just like a woman
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
And the corner sign
Have died in battle or in vain
Darkness at the break of noon
But the second mom was with the seventh son
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Trying to get a lead on
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
The foreign sun, it squints upon
How can the life of such a man
And all their daughters put me down
You don't need a weatherman
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
You take just like a woman
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Will not be understood as they're spoken
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
I don't even care if I ever see her again
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
How many roads must a man walk down
A-she takes just like a woman
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Well, I'm hanging on
In the pigpen
That long, black train is pulling down
And she wakes just like a woman
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Must meet the dawn
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
"Not me," said the gambling man
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
But it's hard to think on
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Advertising signs that con
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
My love, she's like some raven
I figure maybe we're even
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somebody new to beat on
That long, black train is pulling on down
She got such a sweet disposition
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
She said that all the railroad men
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Well, you fake just like a woman
Suicide remarks are torn
And she aches just like a woman
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
There is a place you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
There's nothing you can say or do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
All I'd like you to do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Every place I wanna go
Silvio, I gotta go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
All I really wanna do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
How many times must a man look up
Aladdin and his lamp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
I walked down there and ended up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
What good am I while you softly weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Man in the coon-skin cap
The man in the coon-skin cap
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
For I am married to a house carpenter
Never no more do I wonder
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
I don't have to go far
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Who came here from Cuba's door
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
At any moment you could go under
When only you are near
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
In one I was running and in another
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
But morning is clear
All you boys better run for cover
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
Alone you stand with nobody near
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
My ship is in the harbor
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
So, don't fear if you hear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
I could feel a whole lot better
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
I close my eyes and I wonder
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
For all eternity I think I will remember
The wind howls like a hammer
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
When you whispered in my ear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
I say, "Why you say that for
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
The lover who has just walked out your door
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Still I've always kind of missed her
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Still I say her love-words over
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
The face of God will appear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
You heard me saying a prayer for
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
She took him by his long, yellow hair
And I don't even think about her
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Well, the ragman draws circles
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
But still remains
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
To the cutting of fences
That it's you and no one else that owns
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
He's not selling any alibis
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Romantic facts of musketeers
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Don't follow leaders
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Glide across the lonely years
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Good and bad, I define these terms
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
To memorizing politics
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Don't wear sandals
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And the poor white remains
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
To sharpen the senses
And inside it with the people made of molasses
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I'm gonna let you pass
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
You know that he has no intentions
The empty-handed painter from your streets
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
You should be made to wear earphones
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Mama, you know, awaits the news
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
People on the platforms
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
True love can make a blade of grass
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Statues made of matchsticks
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
You never turned around to see the frowns
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
And the princess and the prince discuss
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Her window's wide open, African trees
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Seven days
I'd gladly confess
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
You been hurt so many times
Six-time losers
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
People carry roses
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
The cowboy angel rides
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
With a fantastic collection of stamps
And your father, to your sister he explains
With a big bouquet of the roses
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Six-time users
And so Patty calls the cops
Now, you must provide some answers
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Girl by the whirlpool's
You can fall down on your knees
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
And, though the masters make the rules
Wants eleven dollar bills
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
But, though the masters make the rules
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
I try to tell it like it is
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
They whisper in the wings
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
I was thinking of a series of dreams
As friends and other strangers
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
At times I think there are no words
What good am I if I say foolish things
We living in times when men commit crimes
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
And then complains
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And tells me of her dreams
Thinking of a series of dreams
And I try to harmonize with songs
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And without further notice asks you how it feels
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Plants in the bed, but
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Johnny's in the basement
But, if the arrow is straight
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
And, since my feet are now fast
It don't take too long to find out
By the way, that's a cute hat
He built a fire on Main Street
One more night the moon is shining bright
Well, I finally started thinking straight
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
She seems too far out
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I'm on the pavement
There's some people that
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
I think that it's best
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Yet you know there is no answer fit
That might be all that you got
They tell me to be discreet
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Without any doubt
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
In the stillness of the midnight
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
You don't forget
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Talking that the heat put
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Everyone still talks about
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
The slow one now will later be fast
They tell me revenge is sweet
How many years can a mountain exist
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
You used to laugh about
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Keep me set apart
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
I got into the driver's seat
I soon get some rest
You're gonna get hit
So he never thinks straight
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
How many years can some people exist
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
You are there in the flickering light
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
In the precious winds they rot
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
But, then again, there's only one I've met
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
He really wasn't where it's at
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
To hold each other tight
You're hearing my heart beat
Wait for the morning light
One more night I will wait for the light
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Everything is always right
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
And the first one now will later be last
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
You used to laugh-make fun about
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
And I, in my armor, turning about
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
With your pockets well protected at last
Keep it in your mind and not forget
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
The slowest now will later be fast
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Ain't it hard when you discover that
I'm moving after midnight
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
To protect you and defend you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
To be alone with you
I can be just like you
It's just crazy being here with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
And I tell this truth to you
I'll remember you
I just might have to come see you
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
With only you in view
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Sooner or later one of us must know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
The only one I know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Down every street there's a window
Now, you're probably wondering by now
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
It only goes to show
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
But sooner or later one of us must know
Well, I'd sure like to know
I'd sure like to know
He been living there three years now
Don't it always a-go to show
Don't it always go to show
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
So I run down most hurriedly
But you can never steal away
To those condemned to act accordingly
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
But I wish there was something you would do or say
And I'm leaving every day to run away
And that which you've given me today
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
And the only tune my guitar could play
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
The Spanish-American War had its day
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Or if you just want some company
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
I did not do it harmfully
Went to the doctor the very next day
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Is worth more than I could pay
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
For them that think death's honesty
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
My ears hear a symphony
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
The same thing I would want today
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
She smiles, walks the other way
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
She puts it to me plain as day
From phony jealousy
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
We banged the drum slowly
Well, I'm walking down the highway
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
That I was just a puppet in a play
But I can't deny
And for His love they took His life away
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
And the ladies treat me kindly
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
That I done it the way
Don't you tell Henry
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
He made the bells of freedom ring today
A cock is crowing far away
No, you'll not now or no other day
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Though I'd never say
She knocked upon it anyway
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Spouted out that liberty
And it's up to you to say
For them that think death--death's honesty
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
So, I'm walking down your highway
My mind weaves a symphony
I send you all my money
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
So they took him to the infirmary
If I don't take the chance to try
Maggie says that many say
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Well, I saw it advertised one day
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
For them that must obey authority
