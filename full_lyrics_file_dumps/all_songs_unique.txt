Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Alright!

<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Dignity never been photographed!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
For that reason I will have to stay."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
They look as dark as night."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
I would want again tomorrow."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Tangled up in blue."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
So write to her tenderly."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
We'll both go off together."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Country'll grow."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
You must know about my debutante."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
You can't blame me at all."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
We'll both go home together."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
And hung on a willow tree."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
They look as white as snow."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
But I know what you want."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You can't blame us at all."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
"Is it easy to forget?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
I'll bring back my lady."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
And have it on Highway 61."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
I can't find my knees."
And it's all for the love of thee."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
That you must always first forgive them."
Come flowing down so free?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
"That way down Highway 61."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
I'll endow them onto thee."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
He said, "Tell me about it."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Has kindly assisted me home."
And punched my cigarette."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Will mourn for your return."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
We want folksingers here."
God said, "On Highway 61."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Have it on Highway 61."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
I didn't see you around."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
I'll see her soon, I know."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
It's all for the love of thee."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Where you and I will unite."
You and I'll never know."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
And keep him good company."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
I'll apply them all to thee."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
I love far better than thee."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
And pretend that you never have met."
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
And comes to a permanent stop,
A hand set the spark,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
In the little church a-this side of town,
You were snow, you were rain,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I got two white horses following me,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
I want my arms around you,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Well, I'm so glad,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
I went out last night to take a little round,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Who will promise never to part,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
True love, they've been without it,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Well, get sick, get well,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Beyond here lies nothing,
But he can't be blamed,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Stone you when you are young and able,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Each time we meet, love,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Made of silver or of golden,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
He's young and on fire,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Searching high, searching low,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
I can make it through,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
I run right home and I went to bed,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
But, to remain as friends,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
And, though the line is cut,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I been good,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I been good while I been waiting,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Had a dream about you, baby,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
And you make love just like a woman,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Look away, you rolling river,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Giving back all of what you owe,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Made before the foundation of the world,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
And it's like I ain't here,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Eh, see what you can do,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
If ever I prove false to you,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
But the time ain't tall,
Precious father, loving mother,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Dream about you, baby,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Joey, Joey,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
But you try with your whole soul,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
See her in that very tight skirt,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Some things are too hot to touch,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
And played the fife lowly,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
In the end,
Don't let yourself fall,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Every head is so dignified,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Thieving in the alley,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
For his age he is wise,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Cares not to come up any higher,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I try my best to be like I am,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Tears on the letter that I write,
When there is no more,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
I don't care if you feel like me,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
And joined the John Birch Society,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
It could even be like a myth,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Searching everywhere I know,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
I been riding the midnight train,
Like a complete unknown,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Just like I did before,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Thank You, Lord,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
I'm gonna let you pass,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
I'd give you the sky high above,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
When you think that you've lost everything,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Staying far behind without you,
Three angels up above the street,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Into my own parade,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Trust yourself,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
And I got those worried blues,
You got something better,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Just remember that death is not the end,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
You were striped, you were plain,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
In another I witnessed a crime,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
And every cause that ever I fought,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
When the night comes falling,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
You can raise up your right hand,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
That can do what's a-never been done,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
All them prophets good and gone,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
No, nothing was delivered,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Without a love of my own,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
In the lonely night,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
I don't want to meet your kin,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
And ride a horse along the trail,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
But I will be back, I will survive,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
I've been all around the world, boys,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
To know how much I really care,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
You got something I want plenty of,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Circled by the circus sands,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Equality, liberty,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
And on the highway of regret,
Paradise, sacrifice,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Far past the frozen leaves,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
To be out on your own,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Going, going, gone,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Oh, watered-down love,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
People going down to the ground,
He won't do nothing to you,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
I'll be on my way,
To be alone with you,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
May be living in another country under another name,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Never weak, but always strong,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Don't you tell Henry,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
New morning,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Seem like I been down this way before,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Precious memories, how they linger,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Where life and death are memorized,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Laying low,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
I don't wanna fake you out,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
The day would surely have to break,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
God knows there's a river,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Don't let me change my heart,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Going, going,
Trouble,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
But now morning is clear,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
In one the surface was frozen,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
And point away from the past,
It's like I ain't here,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Just don't know what to do,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
I'd already gone the distance,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
God knows it's a crime,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
To be without a home,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
I got those worried blues,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
It always means so much,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
The country music station plays soft,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
If anything is gonna sell,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Pick you up every time you fall,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Better jump down the manhole,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Grandpa died last week,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Up and down the block,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Something about you that I can't shake,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Resent him to the bone,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
In a pine box for all eternity,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
God don't call it treason,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
To be one your own,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
On this new morning, new morning,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
My love, she speaks like silence,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
With his fist in a clinch,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Honey, I will meet you there,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Not the end, not the end,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
And they––they look at me and frown,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
When God and man will be reconciled,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Father of day, father of night,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
To find out if she's talked,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
The Communists was a-coming around,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
You had enough of hatred,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
In the ruins of your balcony,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
They say every man must need protection,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
With no direction home,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
I just keep pressing on,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Wintertime in New York town,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
I'm going out of my mind,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Like you never did before,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Under the microscope,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
I can't understand,
Is used, it is plain,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Or select you or dissect you,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Broken switches, broken gates,
And the point is slick,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Don't wanna be a bum,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
God knows there's a purpose,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
I had a dream about you, baby,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Well, I been gambling so long,
She would have married me,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Ye shall be changed,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
The sky too is folding over you,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Don't let her hear,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
All you can do is do what you must,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
For her to arrive,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
I can change, I swear,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
The sky too is folding under you,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
It hurts me, too,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
The night passed away so quickly,
Human gods aim for their mark,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
And the sooner you come up with them,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I wish tonight were here,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
But it ain't me, babe,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
I can't be good, baby,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
But you were gambling for support,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Adiós, mi corazón,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
So I got those worries blues,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
If not for you,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Going,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
You got to serve somebody,
Icicles hanging down,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Want you,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Baby, please stop crying,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Speaking to some French girl,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
I fell down to my bended knees,
But, it ain't me, babe,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Why she did go,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
But I know that he don't talk,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
My dear, sweet friend,
But it ain't him to blame,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
We live in a political world,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Name of Martin Luther King,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
A worried man with a worried mind,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Like as not, it's better so,
China doll, alcohol,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Only one thing I did wrong,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
At the close of the day,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Far away from it all,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Watered-down love,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Looking 'bout the government,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
The carpet too is moving under you,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
When she lays upon the grass,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
For all intended purposes,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
That five walls cannot hide him,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
You and me, we had completeness,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
And, if anybody asks me,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Every brain is civilized,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
To shine in through,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Wasn't making any great connection,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Well, I may just swear,
Mercury, gravity,
Without your sweet love,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
When all will be well,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
The haunted, frightened trees,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
I bless the day I found you,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Loyalty, unity,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
As human gods aim for their mark,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I'm going back to Colorado,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
And to come every time you call,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Never did feel this way before,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Get born, keep warm,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
I'm going down the river,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Don't try No Doz,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
The midnight rain follows the train,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
The night would see me wide awake,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Every nerve is analyzed,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Looking for a new fool,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Father of time and father of dreams,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Don't tie no bows,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
God knows how to make it flow,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Private reasons, great or small,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Rabbit running down across the road,
And all of your children start to resent you,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Saved,
Like a dog on a chain,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
As the present now will later be past,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
To have––be on your own,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Says he's got a bad bill,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
She said she would always stay,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
The light I never knowed,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Well, I don't mind dying,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Hold me, baby, be near,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
No direction home,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Look out, kid,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
The country doctor rambles,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
You have given me life to live,
I'm leaving today,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Tell her not to worry,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
May be the head of some big TV network,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Need a woman all the time,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
It's a price I have to pay,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
She never does me wrong,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
You'll be doing society a favor,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
And I––I walk out on my own,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
But, if I will save you the time,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
A man named Martin Luther King,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
And she aches just like a woman,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
A man with a badge skips by,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Socialism, hypnotism,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Watch the river flow,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
So unknown,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Someone to open each and every door,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
For she ain't the same,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Don't put yourself over the line,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
I think we better talk this over,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
While paupers change possessions,
God sees it all unfold,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
But something has changed,
And, if I see the day,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
And ye shall be a-changed,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
People talk over situations,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
I got a wife and five little children,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
May you stay forever young,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Now you don't talk so loud,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
And may you stay forever young,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
They say every distance is not near,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Face full of black soot,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
By losers, cheaters,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Yesterday is just a memory,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Someone to close his heart,
God knows it's terrifying,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Never needed to call you my whore,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
The beat is pumping,
I went into the red, went into the black,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
I just don't know what to do,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
The human mind can only stand so much,
It still ain't me, babe,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
You better chew gum,
Went to the station down in the yard,
She said she would never forget,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
A million faces at my feet,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
I want you so bad,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Over your senses you have no control,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
All the silver, all the gold,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Stone you and say good luck,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Love don't have any place,
Go down to the river, babe,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
My woman's never sitting at home,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Hmm, I can make it through,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Every moon is so sanctified,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
She's opened up a happy home,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Whether you are right or wrong,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
And gathering storms may arise,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
I can see the turning of the key,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Don't matter what you did,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Serve somebody,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
I can't cross the line, you know,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Is looking for a new fool,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Makes no difference where she's been,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
I'm never, never far from home,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
When I seen him lose control,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
For the politician's gain,
True love of mine,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
This world is ruled by violence,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
That fired the gun,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Stone you just like they said they would,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
And to come each time you call,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Just then the order came to charge,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
The Second World War came to an end,
I can finish this alone, honey,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
It's alright,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
And I know what you're thinking of,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Father of cold and father of heat,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
But you're doing it again,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
And I don't want to drag you down,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
If'n you don't know by now,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
In love and with kindness,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Oxford Town around the bend,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
A thousand miles from home,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
By users, cheaters,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Analyze you, categorize you,
I need a shot of love,
Love that's pure no accident,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
They––they show me to the door,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
If she ain't feeling well,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
But, if I can save you any time,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
By rivers of blindness,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Precious angel under the sun,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Bring the wife and family,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
They say that every man must fall,
Pressing on,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Tell me that you love me only,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
I never can go because, you know,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
God knows you ain't pretty,
They say everything can be replaced,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
You'll change your last name, too,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
She'll surely turn to white,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Come all without, come all within,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Don't know what to do without it,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
And I'm just like that bird,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
To be so useless and all,
One by one until there were none,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
It all seemed so well-timed,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
A dream about you, baby,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Carved next to his name,
They lowered him down as a king,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
I went down where the vultures feed,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I got a bird that whistles,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
They don't believe in mercy,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
My senses have been stripped,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
With the juice running down my leg,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Oh, Angelina,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
And not going through any great extreme,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
God knows there's a heaven,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
In the turning of twilight,
You will be alright, girl,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
You don't have to feed me,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
And give him back the time he's done,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
You even make love just like a woman,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Want you so bad,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
To stay closer than any friend,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
I've been saved – well, alright,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
They say every man needs protection,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
To hang and to lynch,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
I thank the Lord,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
God knows it's fragile,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Don't let her see,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
This situation can only get rougher,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Said I'm pressing on,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
And I'm back in the rain,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Who among them would try to impress you,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
You have given all there is to give,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Thinking about the government,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
In the shadows of moonlight,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
The kingdoms of experience,
You could look at it and weep,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Without a dream in my heart,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
People carry roses,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Make you spin or do you in,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
And the whole world is on your case,
Stand up straight and tall,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Corrina, Corrina,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Of this I can't say very much,
Heart of mine,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
I threw it all away,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
You're beautiful beyond words,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Too noble to neglect,
She's the worst you could ever have,
We'll fly the night away,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
And, although that we're single and free,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
God knows there's a chance,
Father of black, father of white,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Nothing too very scientific,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
It always has hit me from below,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Get back, write Braille,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
One summer's day he came passing by,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Ten thousand men on the move,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
God knows everything,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Don't steal, don't lift,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Eh, in somebody's room,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
I know I can't win,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Don't ever try to change me,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Had no one to go my bail,
Madams light the candles,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Give you my money, honey,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
You need something to open up a new door,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Carry the New York Times,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
She leave by the other and roam,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Keep a clean nose,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Look who's back in town,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
To gather flowers constantly,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Ever since I been a child,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
First degree and second degree,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Says he's got a bad cough,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
To hide 'neath a hood,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
It was from her ship sailing,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
I won't have my nature way,
We take great delight in our own company,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
With a killer's pride, security,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
You can run down to the desert,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Automobile coming into style,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Loneliness, tenderness,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
And forget my pride,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
And here I sit so patiently,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
That the laws are with him,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Well, well, well,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
One by one they follow the sun,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
God knows it's outta sight,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Seven days,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Where mercy walks the plank,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Far away in the stormy night,
How he died nobody could say,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
I like the way that you move your hips,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
That long, black train is pulling down,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
She got great big hind legs,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Keep me where you are,
That you'd have liked me to,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Two by two they step in the dark,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Out to the windy beach,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Aim well, my little one,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Come on, come on, stick together,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Who could they get to carry you,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Can't find what I need,
On the stone that remains,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
To a solid rock,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
More people kept a-piling on,
I just say no thanks,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
You stole her love from me one day,
Eh, singing just for you,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I'm so glad,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Day you quit me, baby,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
I shall be released,
With what your fate is going to be,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Over the hills and far away,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
I want you,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
To be on your own,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Simplify you, classify you,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
You've got to serve somebody,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
My woman needs it every day,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
But evidently she don't,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
You have explained every mystery,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
It was you who came right through,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
A true love of mine,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Is it really any wonder,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
I got no place left to turn,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
The joint is jumping,
Don't mind the driving rain,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
As his youth now unfolds,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
The winter would hold no spring,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
He's the property of Jesus,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
If your time to you is worth saving,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Go melt back in the night,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
It's really something,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
I should have left this town this morning,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Went back home to the yard,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Vanished from my hand,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
You want watered-down love,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Drifting too far from shore,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
That fellow who never blushes,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
The train leaves at half past ten,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
I rambled out of New York town,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Like some mystery,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Newspapermen eating candy,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Go away from my window,
And I'm so glad,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
We've killed each one,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
It was a girl I learned it from,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I got the worried blues,
Father of air and father of trees,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Try to be a success,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Most of the time it's well understood,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Oh, in somebody's room,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
You made it there somehow,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
In the hills of mystery,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Friends with you,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Ooh, watered-down love,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
But I've been hanging on,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
I've been around this whole country,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
The man there said he loved my sound,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
You married young just like your ma,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
How he died nobody can say,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
It's too bad he had to go,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Just like a rolling stone,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
He got that soft, silky skin,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Mixing up the medicine,
There she come, now, down my way,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Hazel, you called and I came,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
May be an actor in a plot,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Just to know that you are near,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
She once was a true love of mine,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
To protect his white skin,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Stripping away at it all,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Badge out, laid off,
Well, there ain't no going back,
To your tambourine in time,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Silvio, I gotta go,
To keep up his hate,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Well, I can't understand,
Yes, I want you so bad,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
And your streets are getting empty,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
God knows it's a struggle,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
But the bottles are done,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
God knows it's true,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
If today was not a crooked highway,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Heart of mine, be still,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Try hard, get barred,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Watching the river flow,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
But, deep inside my heart,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Since you've been gone,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
But it would not be new,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Broken lines, broken strings,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
And you take just like a woman,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
For the wise men and the fools,
He been around the world and back again,
In the darkness of my night,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Already the fiesta has begun,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
God knows when,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
The day you quit me, baby,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
For something that he never done,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
You wanna drown love,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
And I'm in the shade,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
But I'm pressing on,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Somewhere down the road some day,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
If you'd see me this way,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
You're beautiful to me,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
There's always someone who understands,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
I get my sweet reward,
It's rising up above my head,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Memory, ecstasy,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Yesterday's just a memory,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
How many a year has passed and gone,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Too serious to fool,
Winter would have no spring,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
I had so much left to do,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
They say every man must fall,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Stay away from the train line,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
All I really wanna do,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
In his anger and his shame,
People talk of situations,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Gonna serve somebody,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
In the instant that I preach,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
In the great unknown,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
He is centuries old,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
He's not selling any alibis,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Don't follow leaders,
But, if you want me to,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Like a rolling stone,
Oh, see what you can do,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Or have done something wrong,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
You have given me eyes to see,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Yet every distance is not near,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Don't let me drift too far,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Of ancient history,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Got me a secret membership card,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
We never much thought we could get very old,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
If you'd see me this a-way,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
And you know I could never be your own,
You gotta look some other place,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Alright, I'm so glad,
I'd only have to stay,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Don't wear sandals,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I would not feel so all alone,
You to me were true,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
See you fly or watch you die,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
If I didn't have to guess,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
One by one they followed the sun,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
From their fates try to resign,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Better jump down a manhole,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Where I will always be renewed,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
So, never leave me lonely,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
That her father was going to hang,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Hang around the ink-well,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
They say every man need protection,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
And, if I can save you any time,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
The one we can see and can feel,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Tell me,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
My arms and legs were broken,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
When I was in Missouri,
"Not I," said the referee,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
A complete unknown,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
So glad,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Advertising signs, they con,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
And come every time you call,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
And it ain't me, babe,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
While riding on a train going west,
I have no one to meet,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
And also by his feet,
The night blows cold and rainy,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
And rivers that ran through every day,
God knows you've got to weep,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
My love, she speaks softly,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
And think they're fooling you,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Strangers all give me the news,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Ain't no going back,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
And furnish me with tape,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Without ideals or violence,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
You need something to open your eyes,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I'd be sad and blue,
If you throw it all away,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Far away and over the wall,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Give what I got until I got no more,
"Come along and take a trip,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Don't let yourself stumble,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
That must be what it's all about,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
To be––direction home,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Five by five they tried to survive,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Light yourself a candle,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
I had no one for to go my bail,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
"Not me," said his manager,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
And she makes love just like a woman,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
That one doctor cannot save him,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Get jailed, jump bail,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Forever young, forever young,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
You follow, find yourself at war,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Each one playing a horn,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Don't let her know that you love her,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
And I got the worried blues,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Six months on the chain gang,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
If you must cling to someone,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
How does it feel,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Father of night, father of day,
Oh, singing just for you,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
God don't call it wrong,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Front door shut, back door too,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Till both of us fell by the way,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
They keep it all hid,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
And there's two white horses following me,
To strict party-platform ties,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
You have given everything to me,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Don't let her know,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Father of minutes, father of days,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
But I'm saved,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
She'll be coming forth,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
I went into the city, into the town,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
That can do what's never been done,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I love you, pretty baby,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Relationships of ownership,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I like the cool way you look at me,
The man in the trench-coat,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
You have laid down Your life for me,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Using every angle under the sun,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Waiting for the trains,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
And she'll be coming forth,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Broken idols, broken heads,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
God knows that, when you see it,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
The air is getting hotter,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Nothing was delivered,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
It don't matter what you did,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Got my mind made up,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
My limbs are shaking,
They tell me every man must fall,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
I tried to reach you, honey,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
I once held her in my arms,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
The only son of God Almighty,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Going home,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
They must bust in early May,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
I got my mind made up,
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Democracy don't rule the world --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
That's where you belong --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
And he was a friend of mine.
Shut the light, shut the shade.

Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Ever since I seen you there.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.

To anything I might have tried.
Using ideas as my maps.

And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
You know, I loved her just the same.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.

Your old road's rapidly aging.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.

And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
I'm sad and lonely too.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
You're gonna need my help someday.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Put me outta doors.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
You won't get it for money.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
You want a watered-down love.
You always got more than enough rope.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Patriotism, materialism.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Well, I'm just thumping.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Just crying out that he was framed.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Valentines can't buy her.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
All because his face was brown.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
And it is time for me to slide.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Going through all these things twice.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
It always does when you're with me.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
I know something is changed.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
In fond memory appear.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
In my Cadillac.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
I know they're not what they seem.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
In the border-towns of despair.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Is tearing up your mind.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Epitome, rigidity.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
And try to avoid the scandals.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Mama, you been on my mind.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
And you only got ten.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
I's looking around just to see myself.
An innocent man in a living hell.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
I hope I'm ready.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
At my window with a broken wing.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
To kill with no pain.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Tried to create a next world war.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Ever since we've been apart.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Billy, you been running for so long.
I'm just average, common too.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Rain would gather, too.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Never been so easy or so slow.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Crumble into one another.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Under the midnight moon.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
Just like so many times before.
I don't even know why we come.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Is what this thing here is for.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
To hold me in your arms.

Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Leave no stone unturned.
Memories of what used to be.
And you must realize the danger.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
My love, she speaks softly.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
For your times, they are a-changing.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
They want me for a gambling fight.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
If you throw it all away.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
For as long as love will last.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
I got nothing to go back to now.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Thought I was a communist.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
They both rode off together.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Under the hedges.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
I said that.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.

That can win what's never been won.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Drifting too far from shore.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
On this new morning with you.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
I need a shot of love.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.

But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Got to have done some evil deed.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
Some place so high above the wall.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.

And it seems like I've gotta travel on.

I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
And I'll go last.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
I threw it all away.
And ye shall be changed.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
I scarcely feel the glow.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
But I would never do you wrong.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.

When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
He's only a pawn in their game.

Is gonna be against the law.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
I froze right to the bone.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
My face you'll never see no more.
To know which way the wind blows.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
But no charge held against him could they prove.

She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
To anything I mighta tried.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.

Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
With an iron chain around his neck.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.

Out to the country club and the golf course.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I can't see through it anymore.

It sure feels right on a night like this.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.

Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Someone I really could care for.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
I'm a poet, I know it.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
I got nothing left to burn.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
He could die happily ever after.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
I think this time we should escape.
Honey, baby.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
When she's better only time'll tell.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
I used to care, but things have changed.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
And the sails are spread.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Now and forever let it be me.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
But all I see are dark eyes.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
There was nobody around.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
But he sure left here in style.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
While my conscience explodes.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
It was you who understood.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
Chain you down or be your clown.
By that soft and shining sea.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.

But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.

New morning.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.

She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.

There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
So many people I never saw in my life.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
I can't shoot them anymore.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
I once held her in my arms.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Go find out something only dead men know.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
Bring that bottle over here.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Down along my restless palms.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
You're on the bottom.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
So long, honey babe.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
If you just let me follow you down.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Saying wants company.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
And I's left alone with three children.
To live it you had to explode.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
His voice was low with pain.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.

Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.

I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Wasn't any difference to me.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Unless they're from another world.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
You'll do as much for me.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
That set everybody free.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
In the summertime when you were with me.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
You don't have to be afraid.
Look a-the other way.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
The country doctor rambles.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
But these to tell what's true.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
And no time to think.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
A foreign sound to your ear.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
May you stay forever young.
Lay dead beside him there.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Means another poor boy is underground.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
With all these promises you left for me.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Know not what the years may hold.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
A-lord, protect my child.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
By the saving grace that's over me.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
Nobility, humility.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
It can't be this way everywhere.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Close your eyes, close the door.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Tangled up in blue.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
But the mountains of the past.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
He went down to Oxford Town.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
That's the way I remember her best.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
Mortality, reality.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
I hate bears.
Crying out that he been framed.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
See like me or be like me.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
And I've never been too impressed.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
I can't hear you anymore.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
When you made everybody pay.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
It don't matter, anyhow.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
When my working day's through.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
That linger in the fireball heat.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
And that failure's no success at all.
Six by six...
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
I'm younger than that now.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
She murdered mortal he.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Hear me singing through these tears.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
But simply because it's true.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
And then unto eternity.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
I couldn't find any.
And they gotta cut something.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
We were the wrong side.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Turned on my record player.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
"And stay all night with me.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
Hmm.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
The last radio is playing.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
Right now I'm having trouble.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
The words that her lover had said.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Or put up against the wall.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Even the softest touch.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Soft as music, light as spring.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Than people who are most content.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
It was a normal day.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
You were always so close and still within reach.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Evidently she won't.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
Some speak of the future.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
I remember her whispering yet.
But you're back where you belong.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Without ideals or violence.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
After losing every battle.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
And I'll rock you too.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
On the caboose of the train.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Just you and me.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
With the glory that is to be.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Far down the street we stray.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
You're my baby.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Try to avoid the scandals.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
I had so little time to fail.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
And she had left him to die in there.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
So the radio didn't work so well.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
I had something to protect.
My love winks, she does not bother.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
And it never seemed strange.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
'Steada acting like we never met.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Got ice water in my veins.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Nothing done and nothing said.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Oh, her darling love she found.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Without a love of my own.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Or inspect you or reject you.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
And your highway's getting filled.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Magic in a magical land.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
Someone's watching over you.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
That I left in the French Quarter.
"Don't trill no news on me.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Living down Sonora way.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
I can't fire them anymore.
What looks like the easy way out.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
To see that you're madly in love.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
The sooner you can go.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
The light I never knowed.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Neighborhood bully.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
It would go up against every rule.
It only brings me sorrow.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
You're too hot, darling.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Take me as I am or let me go.
Mama, you are on my mind.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
From my toes up to my ears.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
If it just don't make me hurts.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
She's in some foreign land.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
Bid farewell forever.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
You know the song in my heart.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
He's always on trial for just being born.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
But I can't get close to her at all.
You have no idea what you do to me.
With my suitcase in my hand.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Drink up your blood like wine.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Just what he was talking about.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
His enemies say he's on their land.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
When I run outta things to investigate.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
With the golden loom.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
While the law looks the other way.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
That big, old boat started to sink.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.

And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Like you never done before.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
There were six thousand people there.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
Even before you came in the door.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
At the end of the trail.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.

They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Gal, you're on my mind.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Baby, two feet from the well.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
That Johanna's not here.
Everybody that was hanging out.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Leading me, going home.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
You got it, baby.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
You left me standing out in the cold.
She said she would always stay.
Baby, let me follow you down.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.

Is, baby, be friends with you.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.

Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Until I threw it all away.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Duality, mortality.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
A true love of mine.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Throw my ticket out the window.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was brought up by my brother.
It hurts me, too.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
And there's no time to think.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
The place that I started from.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.

He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
You cast your spell and I went under.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
That must be what it's all about.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
A man named Martin Luther King...
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.

I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
And all I see are dark eyes.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.

Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
When I'm alone with you.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
I see better days and I do better things.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.

Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
The National Guard stands around the door.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Fighting every inch of the way.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
Honey, come and see about me.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.

I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.

Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
I will only let you down.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
That's the day you die.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Join the army if you fail.
At not getting their money's worth.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
And pretend that we never have touched.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.

Paths of victory we shall walk.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.

Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
And light on your right knee.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
You got a heart of stone.
Funny way to start a picnic.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
It don't matter anyhow.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.

Into the land of the midnight sun.

We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
Everybody must get stoned.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.

A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Go lightly on the ground.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.

That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
Step lightly on the ground.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Some place so high above this wall.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
And guarded them as they fell.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
Or stay all night with thee.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Feel further away than ever before.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
They don't make nothing here no more.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
Come on, honey.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Watch the parking meters.
Down to New Orleans.
I want everybody to be free.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Suffering like a fool.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Have fallen from her curls.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
That's really and truly an American.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
You're the only love I've ever known.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
My baby told me I would have to go.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
But mine was a little different, you see.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Everything inside is made of stone.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Just what this song is all about.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Until my dying-day.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.

The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
And shot it fulla holes.

Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.

99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
What some people are gonna do for money.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
Come over here from over there, girl.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Need that woman straight and true.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
For the times, they are a-changing.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
I'd like to know.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
And time is beginning to crawl.
I'll remember you.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
And the Santa Fe.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
But I know that I can't move.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
And then go on home and have my fun.
That number eleven was closing.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
From the little Minnesota town.
The same as my father before him.
Just to take somebody's money away.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
I see that stationmaster too.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
So quickly into autumn.
And tapestry of rhyme.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
If you just let me come home with you.
And the pearls are from Japan.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Tell me.
I got trouble in my mind.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
The time and the place that we'd part.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
With your golden loom.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
Lord, protect my child.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
The night will soon be gone.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
The National Guard stands around his door.
I always thought that he was well.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
In the dark land of the sun.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Because everybody must get stoned.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Looking for a new friend.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Heart of mine.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Trust yourself.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
The sooner you can leave.
Crying out that he was framed.
I can't fight them anymore.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Everything is broken.
Waiting on my burying ground.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Baby, please come home.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
I'm falling in love with you.
It'll never do, somehow.
As the present now will later be past.
Blowing through another no-good town.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Rain would gather too.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Tell me that it isn't true.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
I needed somebody to talk to.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Kisses she gave him three.
She can't find him anywhere.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
And one day he came passing by.
She acts like we never met.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Trying to create a next world war.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
I did not do it knowingly.
But I ain't got Corrina.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
If'n you don't know by now.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
And the mailbox is locked.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Sound like it's on a final run.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Father of love and father of rain.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
He ain't-a got no name.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
Havanageeluh.
Oh, Angelina.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
In the brightness of my day.
And I need you, yeah.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
I shall be released.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
If you won't come out your window.
But I ain't neither one.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
Up and down the lonesome town.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
You're drifting too far from shore.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
And clouds cover up the ground.
I just go pump on it some.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Most of the time.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Rode slowly back again.
All because of the color of his skin.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Where teardrops fall.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
You're a big girl now.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
I don't know.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
When my memory is not so short.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
She once was a true love of mine.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
I'll hold it down for you.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
And laid his life on the line.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Going, going, gone.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
While I'm in the hall.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
And watch the parking meters.
For an instant hand touched hand.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
68, but says he's 24.
For that's the way I remember her best.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
'Cause I don't think about it.
And crime don't have a face.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
What you'll say when you get home.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
It runs both cold and deep.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
You only got ten.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
The whole world is my throne.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Foundationed deep somehow.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
She just acts like we never have met.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Going back where we come from.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Mine alone.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
I got a bird that sings.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Honey, I want you.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
And relive my dreams.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
But you're not even sure what it is.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
But I was raised on the other.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
Come on, baby...
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
That brave and devoted band.
Adiós, mi corazón.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
I just can't do what I done before.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Blood on your saddle.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
His epitaph plain:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Yeah, serve somebody:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
But there's one promise, darling:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Till I come into New York town:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Serve somebody:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Everybody that was hanging out;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Make promises by the hour;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
So many things that we never will undo;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Crumble into one another;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
All lies and jest;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Had to be held down by big police;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
I find complete love;
Some speak of the future;
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<p>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Before you call him a man?
When he's standing in front of you?
Too many people have died?
Are you ready?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Baby, can I come home with you?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
How does it feel?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
But am I still dreaming yet?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Across the swooping plain?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
By golly, what more can I say?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Just what in the world has come over you?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
What else can a poor boy do?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Of everything you see?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
How can I live for You?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
How could they let you go?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Before it is washed to the sea?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Before he can hear people cry?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Is it rolling, Bob?
When did you leave heaven?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
What good am I?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Did you respect me for what I did?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
How much poison did they inhale?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Am I still dreaming yet?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
To love and follow His direction?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
How many compared to yesterday?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Must everybody bow?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Why would I want to take your life?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Where did you hide your halo?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
What's wrong with you this time?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
What would life be?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Can I come home with you?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Baby, can't you tell?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Does anyone even try?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How could they ever mistake you?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Am I ready?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
How's everything in heaven?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Don't you remember making baby love?
And how does it feel?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Just like a rolling stone?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Oh, so why not you and me?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Why and what's the reason for?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Gal, where you been so long?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
How long are we gonna be riding?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Across the swamp of time?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Has anybody seen my love?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
That too many people have died?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Where did you lose your wings?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Like a rolling stone?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
How can you say he will haunt you?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Before he can see the sky?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
For all these earthly things?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
What can I do for You?
How many more without any reward?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
What can I give to You?
Have they missed you?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
How many more can they afford?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And one deserving of affection?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Before they're forever banned?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Can you get back in?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Before they're allowed to be free?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
You have to pay to get outta
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, the dog collar's from India
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Things would be different the next time we wed
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
For what you sold that's not been received
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Nothing was delivered
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
I run right home and I went to bed
As I stand upon the sand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
All the sweethearts you can hold
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
I thought that it was well-understood
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I will not go down under the ground
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
But something has changed
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
By no special friend
Everything stays down where it's wounded
And into the path you are hurled
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Standing on the water, casting your bread
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Just what you had in mind
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
I'll always thank the Lord
So I'll make my stand
Either from the mountains of Madrid
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I've been walking around
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
I live in another world
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Many times I've often prayed
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
You used––be so proud
They took a clean-cut kid
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Now you don't act so––so proud
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
He was a clean-cut kid
Now, whenever I get up and
While some, on principles baptized
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Somebody seen him hanging around
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
There ain't nothing in this world
You try so hard, but you don't understand
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
But she ain't gonna find the road
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
"Equality". I spoke the word
Maybe someday you will understand
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
And those whom doom and death had spared
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
We live in a political world
Now, a very great man once said
And things would be different the next time we wed
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
She let go of my hand
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Silvio, silver and gold
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
I want you, baby, just to understand
Now you don't seem so proud
I still can remember the way that you smiled
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
It's something you did
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
I had to say something to strike him very weird
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
How many times can a man turn his head
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
But now something has changed
To see him obviously framed
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
You used to be so amused
And your trouble is you know it too good
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
And then you told me later as I apologized
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Its iron claws attached
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Little did I realize
Well, six white horses that you did promise
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
How was I to know you'd be the one
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Among the lovely people living free
From all the plans they do pursue
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
He'll see by his grave
If dogs run free, why not me
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
I don't even notice she gone
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
You said you'd never compromise
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
What's probably got you baffled more
You just pick anyone
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
When the rain is blowing in your face
The cause was there before we came
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
At dawn my lover comes to me
She knows there's no success like failure
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Full of hope and desire
Waiting to find out what price
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
You smiling through the fence at me
But I feel nothing for their game
You're not free to belong to me
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
She plunged him into well water where
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
To show you something you seen before
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Well, it's all new to me
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And plenty time for good romance
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
So I look like a walking mountain range
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
When the roses fade
"It's only you that he does crave
They say don't come back no more
She been gone
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
So, I called up the operator of time
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
I'm ready for to fade
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
I do declare
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
The man the authorities came to blame
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
But I can't say I sympathize
Should I put them by your gate
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
With all memory and fate
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Hunger pays a heavy price
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
If dogs run free, why not we
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
If dogs run free, then what must be
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Just what you will say when you get home
But the dark does die
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
What you're gonna say when you get home
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
A girl who would murder her own, true love
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
How many ears must one man have
I can survive and I can endure
From the start by the rule
And never sat once at the head of the table
Should I leave them by your gate
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
You say you're looking for someone
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
What good am I then to others and me
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I been wondering all about me
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Breaking hearts up and down the line
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
To give the special one you seek a chance
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
So I remember every face
That she's the same one
The crashing waves roll over me
Remember me to the one who lives there
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Mona tried to tell me
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
There were times when I was so lonesome
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
I rode with him in a taxi once
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Remember me to one who lives there
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
And I ain't complaining none
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
What about that millionaire
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
And you see why it's so unique to be
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
You know, it's not even safe no more
I'm sure you're the one to blame
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Lies that life is black-and-white
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Feel to moan, but unlike before
It'll be with me unto the grave
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
As he rises to fame
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Says it's closing time
A bed that is never mine
Though its shadow's metal badge
But I can get another one
All I feel is heat and flame
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Maybe someday you will look back and see
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Taking care of somebody nice
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Limited in sex they dare
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Just pick anyone
It's all new to me
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
And I would send a message
Up into some paradise
And I'm just the same as anyone else
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Better stay away from those
Knows there's no success like failure
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
And suddenly there appeared before me
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
While them that defend what they cannot see
You into thinking you're the one
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
"That I might be gone a long, old time
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
"Oh, father, you will surely die
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
When I'm all alone
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
It's getting dark, too dark to see
We see this empty cage now corrode
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Why wait any longer for the one you love
You cut to the core
When Reilly's daughter got a message
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
I am homeless, come and take me
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
And her silver-studded phantom cause
And the Negro's name
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
On the rising curve
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
So up she picked her babies three
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Oh, trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
But then a whistle will be blowing
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Where the time and the tempo drag
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
If I was with her too long
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Early in the morning, early in the morning
'Cause the battle outside raging
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Beyond here lies nothing
The order is a-rapidly fading
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Deceived me into thinking
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
It's not a bad way to make a living
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
The order is rapidly fading
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
They're drinking up and walking
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
She rode by night and came by morning
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
You left me standing in the doorway crying
For your weary toes to be touching
There's nothing in here moving
The battle outside raging
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And the cards are no good that you're holding
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Then she told us how times were tough
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I have fallen far beneath
And how I know I'll make it through
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
You go north and you go south
Look out, the saints are coming through
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
The man in me will do nearly any task
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Make everything from toy guns that spark
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
But they caught him and they brought him back
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Shoot in the back
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
I wish she'd unlock
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Well, there ain't no going back
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Her voice once and talk
You turn around to take a final peek
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
All and all can only fall
Soul to soul our shadows roll
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
A girl by the whirlpool
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Then why don't she tell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Muttering small talk at the wall
And if my love is real
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
How many seas must a white dove sail
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Ring bar, hard to tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
He's taught in his school
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Oh, how does it feel
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
They ask me how I feel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Well, if I die on top of the hill
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
I chased me a woman up the hill
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
As the last fire-truck from hell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
How does it feel
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
He's sure got a lot of gall
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Ring bell, hard to tell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
How many seas must the white dove sail
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
A-how does it feel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
"For you cannot relive them
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Two eyes took the aim
But I can hear another drum
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
You better not chew gum
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
So, one morning when the sun was warm
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Now, they asked me to read a poem
And remain as I am
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
For the loser now will be later to win
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
She got such a sweet disposition
Uncle Rat went running downtown
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
How can the life of such a man
Will not be understood as they're spoken
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
And there's no exit in any direction
And she aches just like a woman
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
That long, black train is pulling on down
Their religion of the little ten women
But the second mom was with the seventh son
In the pigpen
But all their daughters put me down
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
And all their daughters put me down
You take just like a woman
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
From heights that they could not gain
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Out of the shower comes a football man
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
How many roads must a man walk down
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Advertising signs that con
He got that fortress on the mountain
But me, I expected it to happen
In ceremonies of the horsemen
For the loser now might be later to win
You need something to make it known
A-she takes just like a woman
And she wakes just like a woman
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
"Not me," said the gambling man
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Why did you trade heaven
Have died in battle or in vain
And you ache a-just like a woman
To remember the times when I was your only man
To my knowledge there's just one man
Well, I'm hanging on
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
But it's hard to think on
All lay down their bandanas and complain
But I swear I see my reflection
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Suicide remarks are torn
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I figure maybe we're even
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Must meet the dawn
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Well, you fake just like a woman
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Somebody new to beat on
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Trying to get a lead on
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Yes, and someone must explain
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
That long, black train is pulling down
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
The ones that jump on the wagon
But the post office has been stolen
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
She said that all the railroad men
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Guns and clubs followed him down
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
I'll be waiting at the station
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Yet I swear I see my reflection
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
The next morning she had awoken
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
She takes just like a woman
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
All their daughters put me down
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Darkness at the break of noon
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Nothing we can call our own
As you sit on the box you keep him in
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
My love, she's like some raven
You don't need a weatherman
And the corner sign
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Every place I wanna go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
All I really wanna do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
There's nothing you can say or do
All I'd like you to do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Silvio, I gotta go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
There is a place you go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
How many times must a man look up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
I walked down there and ended up
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Man in the coon-skin cap
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
What good am I while you softly weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Aladdin and his lamp
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
The face of God will appear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Alone you stand with nobody near
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
The wind howls like a hammer
Who came here from Cuba's door
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
She took him by his long, yellow hair
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
So, don't fear if you hear
When you whispered in my ear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
The lover who has just walked out your door
I could feel a whole lot better
But morning is clear
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Never no more do I wonder
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
I don't have to go far
And I don't even think about her
I say, "Why you say that for
You heard me saying a prayer for
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Still I've always kind of missed her
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
When only you are near
I close my eyes and I wonder
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Still I say her love-words over
All you boys better run for cover
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
My ship is in the harbor
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
In one I was running and in another
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
For all eternity I think I will remember
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
At any moment you could go under
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
For I am married to a house carpenter
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
To the cutting of fences
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And the princess and the prince discuss
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
At times I think there are no words
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
In the dimestores and bus-stations
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Her window's wide open, African trees
Wants eleven dollar bills
And inside it with the people made of molasses
And so Patty calls the cops
Girl by the whirlpool's
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Well, the ragman draws circles
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
People on the platforms
But still remains
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Seven days
I'm gonna let you pass
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
With a big bouquet of the roses
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
When your mother sends back all your invitations
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
You know that he has no intentions
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
I try to tell it like it is
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
I'd gladly confess
The empty-handed painter from your streets
And then complains
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
The cowboy angel rides
They whisper in the wings
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Don't follow leaders
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Now, you must provide some answers
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
How many deaths will it take till he knows
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
You never turned around to see the frowns
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Thinking of a series of dreams
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
True love can make a blade of grass
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
People carry roses
You should be made to wear earphones
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
That it's you and no one else that owns
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
And the poor white remains
To sharpen the senses
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Don't wear sandals
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Good and bad, I define these terms
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
As friends and other strangers
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Statues made of matchsticks
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And, though the masters make the rules
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
We living in times when men commit crimes
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
He's not selling any alibis
To memorizing politics
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Glide across the lonely years
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
With a fantastic collection of stamps
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
What good am I if I say foolish things
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
And tells me of her dreams
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Six-time users
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Mama, you know, awaits the news
But, though the masters make the rules
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
You can fall down on your knees
Six-time losers
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
I let it slip gladly to my friends
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
You been hurt so many times
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Romantic facts of musketeers
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And I try to harmonize with songs
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
And your father, to your sister he explains
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
In the stillness of the midnight
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
And, since my feet are now fast
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
And I, in my armor, turning about
We can hold up a toast if we meet
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Talking that the heat put
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
I got into the driver's seat
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
The slow one now will later be fast
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
They tell me to be discreet
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Like a corkscrew to my heart
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
They tell me revenge is sweet
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Keep me set apart
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Everyone still talks about
You're gonna get hit
You're hearing my heart beat
Wait for the morning light
You used to laugh about
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
That might be all that you got
She seems too far out
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
So he never thinks straight
One more night I will wait for the light
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I'm moving after midnight
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
I think that it's best
And the first one now will later be last
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Keep it in your mind and not forget
There's some people that
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Everything is always right
Ain't it hard when you discover that
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
He built a fire on Main Street
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
In the precious winds they rot
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
I'm on the pavement
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
The slowest now will later be fast
To hold each other tight
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
How many years can a mountain exist
You don't forget
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
It don't take too long to find out
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Without any doubt
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
You are there in the flickering light
One more night the moon is shining bright
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
By the way, that's a cute hat
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Well, I finally started thinking straight
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
I soon get some rest
He really wasn't where it's at
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
But, if the arrow is straight
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Johnny's in the basement
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Someday, everything is gonna be different
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
You used to laugh–make fun about
How many years can some people exist
Plants in the bed, but
With your pockets well protected at last
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I'll remember you
I just might have to come see you
To be alone with you
And I tell this truth to you
To protect you and defend you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
It's just crazy being here with you
I can be just like you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Well, I'd sure like to know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
But sooner or later one of us must know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always go to show
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
He been living there three years now
With only you in view
It only goes to show
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Ring them bells for the chosen few
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
I'd sure like to know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
The only one I know
Down every street there's a window
Don't it always a-go to show
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Sooner or later one of us must know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
But I wish there was something you would do or say
Spouted out that liberty
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Well, I saw it advertised one day
I did not do it harmfully
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
For them that think death––death's honesty
The Spanish-American War had its day
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
And it's up to you to say
No, you'll not now or no other day
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Went to the doctor the very next day
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Is worth more than I could pay
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
He made the bells of freedom ring today
For them that think death's honesty
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And that which you've given me today
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
She starts to speak, but he walks away
To those condemned to act accordingly
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
The same thing I would want today
Someone to get you flowers constantly
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
How many times must the cannon balls fly
That I was just a puppet in a play
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
And the only tune my guitar could play
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Though I'd never say
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
My ears hear a symphony
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Maggie says that many say
From phony jealousy
We banged the drum slowly
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
She smiles, walks the other way
Don't you tell Henry
So they took him to the infirmary
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
But I can't deny
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
That I done it the way
And for His love they took His life away
I send you all my money
She puts it to me plain as day
So I run down most hurriedly
My mind weaves a symphony
So, I'm walking down your highway
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Or if you just want some company
A cock is crowing far away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
If I don't take the chance to try
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
But you can never steal away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
And the ladies treat me kindly
For them that must obey authority
She knocked upon it anyway
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Havanagee–luh–
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Ten thousand miles or more –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
I a-hope you can hear––
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Disconnect these cables––
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Private reasons – great or small –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
With notions his canoe was laden –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
I got no idea what I want –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
One of these days – and it won't be long –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Hang out the whole next day –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
First degree and second degree –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Indians camp along her border –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Haven't seen her since that night –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
To know where you are –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Whispering your secret emotion –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
With no other choice except but for to go –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
How badly they were shocked –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Ha–va–
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Hava–na–
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
You will not hear a laugh –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
I'm sure it was not three –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
I long to hold you in the night –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
I hope that you can hear––
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Remember me to one who lives there –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Oh, my–
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Leave all the children home –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
As suicide remarks are torn –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Havana–gee–
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
