Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Play that guitar now!
It was the mailman!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Start over!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
I figured they was in my TV set!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
Play fucking loud!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Lordy, Lord!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
I'm in love with you!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Thank you!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Oh, yeah!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
He punched me out!
How they ever flood my soul!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Dance!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
Oh, no!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
They got away!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
[incoherent] on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Betty Ross!
Oh!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Goodnight!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
I ain't different than anyone!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Woo!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Hootenanny television!
Alright!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Yeah, man!
So long, New York!
She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Them Reds did it!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Yippee!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
I've got the freight train blues!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
Woo-hoo!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
You must think I'm crazy!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
My God, they killed Him!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
You're a liar!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Alright, now!
I've got a million friends!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
Take me down to California, baby!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Yes, come out your window!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Dignity never been photographed!
Howdy, East Orange!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
She's insane!
Looking for my lo and behold!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
Good God!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, yeah!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
I got the freight train blues!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Well!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
I wanna be yours!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
She takes just like a woman - yes!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
They was all over!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Pressing on - oh, yes, I am!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
From across that lonesome ocean."
I'll endow them onto thee."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
You can't blame us at all."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And hung on a willow tree."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
You can't blame me at all."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
I'll apply them all to thee."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
"That way down Highway 61."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Come flowing down so free?"
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
God said, "On Highway 61."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Country'll grow."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And punched my cigarette."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
We'll both go off together."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
We want folksingers here."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
I would want again tomorrow."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
We'll both go home together."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Get on your horse and ride away."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Would kill a little bird like me."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
I'll see her soon, I know."
So write to her tenderly."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Where you and I will unite."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
They look as dark as night."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
I love far better than thee."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
And keep him good company."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
"I've had too much of your company,"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
I didn't see you around."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Have it on Highway 61."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
That you must always first forgive them."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
You and I'll never know."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
And have it on Highway 61."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
But I know what you want."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
For that reason I will have to stay."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
And pretend that you never have met."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"Is it easy to forget?"
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
And it's all for the love of thee."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
I'll bring back my lady."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I can't find my knees."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
They look as white as snow."
Will mourn for your return."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
You must know about my debutante."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Tangled up in blue."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
It's all for the love of thee."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Spent my money on you, honey,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
A lover for your life and nothing more,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
I can see the turning of the key,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
People talk of situations,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
I just don't see why I should even care,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
The night blows cold and rainy,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Just like a rolling stone,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
With no direction home,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Oh, see what you can do,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
I've been in and out of happiness,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
And to come each time you call,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
To be on your own,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
It's like I ain't here,
In his anger and his shame,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
They run a brick and tile company,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
But now morning is clear,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Stay away from the train line,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Since you've been gone,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
The light I never knowed,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
And forget my pride,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Never did feel this way before,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
God don't call it wrong,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
The sky too is folding under you,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
I'd be sad and blue,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
When all will be well,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Seem like I been down this way before,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
The country doctor rambles,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Day you quit me, baby,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Alright, I'm so glad,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
There's always someone who understands,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Just then the order came to charge,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
I can't understand,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Don't let yourself fall,
She would have married me,
That the laws are with him,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Going,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
I've been around this whole country,
In the end,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
When there is no more,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
This situation can only get rougher,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
God knows how to make it flow,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
But I would not feel so all alone,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Father of black, father of white,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Private reasons, great or small,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
You can hear them tires squeal,
They say that every man must fall,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Precious angel under the sun,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
It hurts me, too,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Face full of black soot,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
I won't have my nature way,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Over your senses you have no control,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
It's a price I have to pay,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
You have given all there is to give,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
The haunted, frightened trees,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
They--they show me to the door,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling,
Dream about you, baby,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Paradise, sacrifice,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
They say every man must need protection,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Ye shall be changed,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Better jump down the manhole,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
The wind blowing the snow around,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
It was from her ship sailing,
Went back home to the yard,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
I ain't looking to block you up,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Don't follow leaders,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
In the hills of mystery,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Icicles hanging down,
Like you never did before,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
The kingdoms of experience,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
To hide 'neath a hood,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
You wanna drown love,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
People talk over situations,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
We'll fly the night away,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
That you'd have liked me to,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Living in the land of Nod,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
They say every distance is not near,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
I would not feel so all alone,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
God knows it's a crime,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
I long to see you in the morning light,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
A man with a badge skips by,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
God knows you've got to weep,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
In the darkness of my night,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Don't wanna be a bum,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Is used, it is plain,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Simplify you, classify you,
Went to the station down in the yard,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
I been good,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
And your streets are getting empty,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Hmm, see what you can do,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
I went down to scrub and rub,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Poor boy never say die,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Hold me, baby, be near,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
Father of minutes, father of days,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Made of silver or of golden,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
A thousand miles from home,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
We live in a political world,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
To have--be on your own,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Go melt back in the night,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
But I'm saved,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Tell me,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
In one the surface was frozen,
One by one they followed the sun,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
For his age he is wise,
There she come, now, down my way,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
May be living in another country under another name,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
The night passed away so quickly,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
And give him back the time he's done,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
That her father was going to hang,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Give you my money, honey,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
They must bust in early May,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
God knows there's a chance,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Laying low,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Try to be a success,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Said I'm pressing on,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Six months on the chain gang,
You stole her love from me one day,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Aim well, my little one,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
When the night comes falling,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I got two white horses following me,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
And, though the line is cut,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
All them prophets good and gone,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Just remember that death is not the end,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
It could even be like a myth,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
And I'm just like that bird,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
For something that he never done,
The train leaves at half past ten,
But the bottles are done,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
If not for you,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Father of air and father of trees,
The angels play on their horns all day,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
And on the highway of regret,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
May you stay forever young,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Like some mystery,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
And here I sit so patiently,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
See her in that very tight skirt,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
You got something better,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
To a solid rock,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
I got those worried blues,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Well, there ain't no going back,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
That fellow who never blushes,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
The only son of God Almighty,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
To your tambourine in time,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
China doll, alcohol,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
My limbs are shaking,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Going, going, gone,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
I rambled out of New York town,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Where mercy walks the plank,
I never can go because, you know,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
You're beautiful to me,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Get born, keep warm,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Far away from it all,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Yesterday is just a memory,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Don't let her hear,
And may you stay forever young,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Go away from my window,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Don't mind the driving rain,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
They say every man need protection,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Heart of mine, be still,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Everything's a-hers or his,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
We'll go someplace unknown,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Don't ever try to change me,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Maybe when we both get sober,
When she lays upon the grass,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
And she makes love just like a woman,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
The man in the trench-coat,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
First degree and second degree,
And gathering storms may arise,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
It's really something,
And think they're fooling you,
I'd already gone the distance,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
And, if anybody asks me,
Just to know that you are near,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
But you were gambling for support,
I went down where the vultures feed,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
We never much thought we could get very old,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Of ancient history,
For the politician's gain,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
That four ears cannot hear him,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
He won't do nothing to you,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
So glad,
It always has hit me from below,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
You to me were true,
To stay closer than any friend,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Is looking for a new fool,
My woman needs it every day,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
The night would see me wide awake,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Don't let her see where you're going,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
She once was a true love of mine,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
The sky too is folding over you,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Rabbit running down across the road,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Like a rolling stone,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
And also by his feet,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
I get my sweet reward,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Five by five they tried to survive,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
By losers, cheaters,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Roll, Willie, roll,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
No direction home,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Loneliness, tenderness,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
From their fates try to resign,
My arms and legs were broken,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Don't try No Doz,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Far past the frozen leaves,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
She leave by the other and roam,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
You were snow, you were rain,
They don't believe in mercy,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
Who could they get to carry you,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Well, I gave you all my money,
They keep it all hid,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
One more night the stars are in sight,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Someone to open each and every door,
Gonna serve somebody,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
And the whole world is on your case,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Got my mind made up,
Vanished from my hand,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Look out, kid,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
And she'll be coming forth,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Don't wear sandals,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
When I seen him lose control,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Looking 'bout the government,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
You've got to serve somebody,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
And I'm so glad,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
I just don't know what to do,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
It was you who came right through,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Going home,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Father of night, father of day,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Grandpa died last week,
You better chew gum,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Ye shall be a-changed,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Come all without, come all within,
By rivers of blindness,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Tell her not to worry,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Couldn't even see the floor,
For the wise men and the fools,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
That can do what's a-never been done,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
To find out if she's talked,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
It's alright,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
The country music station plays soft,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
She got great big hind legs,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
You have given me life to live,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
The winter would hold no spring,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Carved next to his name,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
If'n you don't know by now,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
For she ain't the same,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
To keep up his hate,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Love don't have any place,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
And point away from the past,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Wasn't making any great connection,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I thank the Lord,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Stripping away at it all,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
I once held her in my arms,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Too serious to fool,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Searching high, searching low,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
That can do what's never been done,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Ever since I been a child,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
So many roads, so much at stake,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
If she ain't feeling well,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
I'm going back to Colorado,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
And I got the worried blues,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Just don't know what to do,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
He's not selling any alibis,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Stone you and say good luck,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
But, if I will save you the time,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
It was a girl I learned it from,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
I know I can't win,
"Not me," said his manager,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
God knows it's fragile,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
A million faces at my feet,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
To strict party-platform ties,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Out to the windy beach,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Well, come all without, come all within,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
To be so useless and all,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Well, get sick, get well,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
In love and with kindness,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
She said she would always stay,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
But, deep inside my heart,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Heart of mine,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Someone who will die for you and more,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
The day you quit me, baby,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
A worried man with a worried mind,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
One summer's day he came passing by,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
She's opened up a happy home,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Someone to close his hear,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Oxford Town around the bend,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
I love you, pretty baby,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Under the microscope,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Beating for the dead that rise,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Looking for a new fool,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
And to come every time you call,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Somewhere down the road some day,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
I'm gonna let you pass,
And not going through any great extreme,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
I got my mind made up,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Don't let me drift too far,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
I'd only have to stay,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
God knows everything,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
You got to serve somebody,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
One by one they follow the sun,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Billy, you're so far away from home,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
They walk among the stately trees,
Father of day, father of night,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
I got a bird that whistles,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
New morning,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
I have no one to meet,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
To be out on your own,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Three angels up above the street,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Don't let me change my heart,
By users, cheaters,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I went into the city, went into the town,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
I like the way that you move your hips,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Like as not, it's better so,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Analyze you, categorize you,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
The wind howls like a hammer,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
With his fist in a clinch,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
But, to remain as friends,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Trust yourself,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
And I'm in the shade,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Well, the way I love that woman,
With his candle lit into the sun,
That long, black train is pulling down,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Front door shut, back door too,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
In the instant that I preach,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
We've killed each one,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
In the great unknown,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Equality, liberty,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
And you take just like a woman,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
You had enough of hatred,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
She said she would never forget,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Carry the New York Times,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Seven days,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
I try my best to be like I am,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Without ideals or violence,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
A hand set the spark,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
But I'm pressing on,
One by one until there were none,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
If your time to you is worth saving,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
If ever I prove false to you,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
They tell me every man must fall,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
If you throw it all away,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
To be alone with you,
Winter would have no spring,
You can run down to the desert,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Thieving in the alley,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
When you think that you've lost everything,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Look who's back in town,
To be--direction home,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
A man named Martin Luther King,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
That they do not respect in any degree,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Got me a secret membership card,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Like a complete unknown,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
I like the cool way you look at me,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
You gotta look some other place,
Is it really any wonder,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Tell me that you love me only,
Beyond here lies nothing,
I'm leaving today,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Something about you that I can't shake,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
And it ain't me, babe,
Only one thing I did wrong,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Don't tie no bows,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Make you spin or do you in,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
"Not I," said the referee,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
With the juice running down my leg,
Holding his club like he was a king,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
You don't have to feed me,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
I got the worried blues,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
In a pine box for all eternity,
I bless the day I found you,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing,
They say everything can be replaced,
Waiting for the trains,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
While paupers change possessions,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
I'm going down the river,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
At the close of the day,
Stand up straight and tall,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Memory, ecstasy,
I don't care if you feel like me,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Badge out, laid off,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
And I got those worried blues,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Father of loneliness and pain,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Now, won't you tell me true,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Light yourself a candle,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Giving back all of what you owe,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
God knows there's a purpose,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I want you so bad,
She never does me wrong,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
And, when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Drifting too far from shore,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
You even make love just like a woman,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
By the night and been to some place new,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
In the ruins of your balcony,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
She's the worst you could ever have,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
No, nothing was delivered,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
True love, they've been without it,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
It don't matter what you did,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Oh, watered-down love,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Strike another match, go start anew,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
All you can do is do what you must,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Nothing too very scientific,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
But I will be back, I will survive,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Two by two they step in the dark,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
I threw it all away,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
While riding on a train going west,
To shine in through,
Wintertime in New York town,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Joey, Joey,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Just as long as you stay with me,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Pressing on,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
But, if I can save you any time,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Far away in the stormy night,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
People going down to the ground,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
It's too bad he had to go,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Up and down the block,
First to come in was the flying moth,
People carry roses,
Love that's pure no accident,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
My hands can't feel to grip,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Into my own parade,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
The day would surely have to break,
Corrina, Corrina,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
The phone's tapped anyway,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Poor boy dressed in black,
As human gods aim for their mark,
To protect his white skin,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
He is centuries old,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
To hang and to lynch,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
Every brain is civilized,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Adios, mi corazon,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
How does it feel,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
But evidently she don't,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Staying far behind without you,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
True love of mine,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
I want my arms around you,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
You have given everything to me,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
To gather flowers constantly,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
She'll be coming forth,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Made before the foundation of the world,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Circled by the circus sands,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
A lover for your life, but nothing more,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Forever young, forever young,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Someone to close his heart,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
My dear, sweet friend,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
I need a shot of love,
Yet every distance is not near,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Go down to the river, babe,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
My hands didn't touch him none,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
She'll surely turn to white,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
And, if I see the day,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
I can make it through,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
But something has changed,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
It always means so much,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
With what your fate is going to be,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
To know how much I really care,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Who will promise never to part,
Nothing was delivered,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
Broken buckles, broken laws,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
You were striped, you were plain,
Searching everywhere I know,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Going, going,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Keep a clean nose,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
I've been all around the world, boys,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Advertising signs, they con,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Get jailed, jump bail,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
It still ain't me, babe,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I had so much left to do,
I wish tonight were here,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Precious father, loving mother,
I went into the city, into the town,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Ain't no going back,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Loyalty, unity,
And I--I walk out on my own,
Every nerve is analyzed,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Watching the river flow,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
God sees it all unfold,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Over the hills and far away,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
You'll be doing society a favor,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Mercury, gravity,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
You married young just like your ma,
A dream about you, baby,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Don't let her see,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Well, I'm so glad,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Broken idols, broken heads,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Where I will always be renewed,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
And ye shall be a-changed,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Just like I did before,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
I been riding the midnight train,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Baby, please stop crying,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
All that and more and then some,
How he died nobody could say,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
And it's like I ain't here,
All the silver, all the gold,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
If anything is gonna sell,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
We take great delight in our own company,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
I got a wife and five little children,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Like a dog on a chain,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Or select you or dissect you,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
I'd give you the sky high above,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Trouble,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
God knows there's a river,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping,
God knows it's outta sight,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
God knows that, when you see it,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Hang around the ink-well,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Friends with you,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
And, if I can save you any time,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Can't find what I need,
I got no place left to turn,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
Ten thousand men on the move,
The air is getting hotter,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Keep me where you are,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
I can finish this alone, honey,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
You could look at it and weep,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
I'm never, never far from home,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
A complete unknown,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
I just keep pressing on,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
He been around the world and back again,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
You need something to open your eyes,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Strangers all give me the news,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
And furnish me with tape,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Yes, I want you so bad,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Don't matter what you did,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Without a love of my own,
Get back, write Braille,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
The one we can see and can feel,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Father of cold and father of heat,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Eh, see what you can do,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
You will be alright, girl,
Want you,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
And comes to a permanent stop,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
To be one your own,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
I want you,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Resent him to the bone,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Tears on the letter that I write,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
All I really wanna do,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
They pass by so silently,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
As the present now will later be past,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Madams light the candles,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
May be the head of some big TV network,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
I been good while I been waiting,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
And I'm back in the rain,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Better jump down a manhole,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
And she aches just like a woman,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I went back home, put on my tie,
You have explained every mystery,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Eh, singing just for you,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
But you're doing it again,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Far away and over the wall,
On this new morning, new morning,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
The Second World War came to an end,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
God knows it's a struggle,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
In the shadows of moonlight,
You got something I want plenty of,
Each time we meet, love,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
I'm going out of my mind,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Of this I can't say very much,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
But he can't be blamed,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Get dressed, get blessed,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
A true love of mine,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
You made it there somehow,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
I just say no thanks,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
You'll change your last name, too,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
The man there said he loved my sound,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
We live and we die, we know not why,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Now you don't talk so loud,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
But it ain't him to blame,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Mixing up the medicine,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
God don't call it treason,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
You say my kisses are not like his,
God knows there's a heaven,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
In the lonely night,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Well, I may just swear,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
You need something to open up a new door,
Says he's got a bad bill,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
But the time ain't tall,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
It's rising up above my head,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
On the stone that remains,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
You follow, find yourself at war,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Four by four, no illusion for,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
The joint is jumping,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
How many a year has passed and gone,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
For her to arrive,
You can raise up your right hand,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Need a woman all the time,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
I can't cross the line, you know,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I'll be on my way,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
God knows it's true,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Want you so bad,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Watered-down love,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Don't you tell Henry,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Thank You, Lord,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Bringing me all of your charms,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Don't know what to do without it,
I can change, I swear,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
So, never leave me lonely,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
You want watered-down love,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
I could have left this town by noon,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
But it ain't me, babe,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
And played the fife lowly,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Bring the wife and family,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Try hard, get barred,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Automobile coming into style,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Puffing on a big cigar,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
You're beautiful beyond words,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
God knows it's terrifying,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
I shall be released,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
I'm pledging my time to you,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
And the point is slick,
In the little church a-this side of tow,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
This place ain't doing me any good,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
The Communists was a-coming around,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
They say every man must fall,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
And, on their promises of paradise,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
And, although that we're single and free,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Saved,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
As his youth now unfolds,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
And there's two white horses following me,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Relationships of ownership,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Broken hands on broken plows,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
He's the property of Jesus,
"Come along and take a trip,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
But, if you want me to,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Serve somebody,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Why she did go,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
The beat is pumping,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
If you'd see me this way,
You better duck down the alleyway,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
But you try with your whole soul,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
I should have left this town this morning,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
They say every man needs protection,
Had no one to go my bail,
Well, I don't mind dying,
My existence led by confusion boats,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Where life and death are memorized,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
More people kept a-piling on,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Without your sweet love,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Using every angle under the sun,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
I tried to reach you, honey,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
If I didn't have to guess,
And rivers that ran through every day,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Without a dream in my heart,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Don't let her see that you need her,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Oh, Angelina,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
That fired the gun,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I wish I a-was a magician,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
But it would not be new,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
But ye shall be a-changed,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
At ships with tattooed sails,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
I can't be good, baby,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
That must be what it's all about,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
You have given me eyes to see,
But I know that he don't talk,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
They lowered him down as a king,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
And all of your children start to resent you,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Never weak but always strong,
See you fly or watch you die,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Well, well, well,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Not the end, not the end,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Oh, singing just for you,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
With a killer's pride, security,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
So I got those worries blues,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
And every cause that ever I fought,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Each one playing a horn,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
May be an actor in a plot,
If you must cling to someone,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Drag you down or drain you down,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Don't let her know,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Watch the river flow,
God knows when,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
He's young and on fire,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
In the turning of twilight,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I'm so glad,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
But I've been hanging on,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Cares not to come up any higher,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
You came down on me like white thunder,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Every head is so dignified,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Don't let yourself stumble,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Speaking to some French girl,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Hazel, you called and I came,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
So unknown,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
That five walls cannot hide him,
The midnight rain follows the train,
I've been saved - well, alright,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Who's never weak but always strong,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
My senses have been stripped,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
My love, she speaks softly,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
This world is ruled by violence,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Thinking about the government,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Or have done something wrong,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
And it still ain't me, babe,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
I think we better talk this over,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
When I was in Missouri,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Too noble to neglect,
And you make love just like a woman,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
God knows you ain't pretty,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
You and me, we had completeness,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
How he died nobody can say,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Most of the time it's well understood,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
And come every time you call,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
For all intended purposes,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Well, I can't understand,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Look away, you rolling river,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
And you know I could never be your own,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
To be without a home,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
With notions his canoe was laden -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
I hope that you can hear--
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
To know where you are -
Haven't seen her since that night -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
With no other choice except but for to go -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
That's where you belong --
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
How badly they were shocked -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Remember me to one who lives there -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Hang out the whole next day -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
Whispering your secret emotion -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
Ha-va-
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
Ten thousand miles or more -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
Democracy don't rule the world --
I ask you how things could get much worse -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
That can win what's a-never been won -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
You will not hear a laugh -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Turn, turn, turn again -
I got no idea what I want -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
Private reasons - great or small -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
Oh, my-
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
As suicide remarks are torn -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
Havanagee-luh-
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
Leave all the children home -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
Havana-gee-
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Disconnect these cables--
Without a reply I left by the moon -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
Thank--
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
First degree and second degree -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
I a-hope you can hear--
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Indians camp along her border -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
I'm sure it was not three -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
Hava-na-
I long to hold you in the night -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
It can't be this way everywhere -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
You know, I loved her just the same.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
You always got more than enough rope.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
You're my baby.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Take me as I am or let me go.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
Said it was a bad dream.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Drink up your blood like wine.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
The whole night through.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
But I would never do you wrong.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Until my dying-day.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
I hate bears.
Blowing through another no-good town.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Soft as music, light as spring.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Using ideas as my maps.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Six by six...
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
I only saw what they let me see.
Throw my mattress out there too.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
But you can't see in and I--it's hard looking out.
Tell me.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
She acts like we never met.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Fighting every inch of the way.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
For she once was a true love of mine.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Some place so high above this wall.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Everything is gonna be fine.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
The sooner you can go.
What's real and what is not.
Ever since we've been apart.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
In fond memory appear.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
Good car to drive, after a war.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
In the brightness of my day.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
Rain would gather too.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
But you were tangled up in blue.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
So I beg you: let it be me.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
I once held her in my arms.
I'll only let you down.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
I can't fight them anymore.
Calling out that he's been framed.
What some people are gonna do for money.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Come on, baby.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
But he sure left here in style.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
All because of the color of his skin.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
But my heart just won't give in.
I'm falling in love with you.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
My love winks, she does not bother.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
You'll never see me frown.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
I had so little time to fail.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
And I was brought up by my brother.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
While the law looks the other way.
That old ship was a-going down.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
It was you who understood.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Try to avoid the scandals.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Bring that bottle over here.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
And discovered her invisible self.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Trust yourself.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
And all your raging glory.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
But everybody else - even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
Like you never done before.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing - I just might tell you the truth.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.

To know which way the wind blows.
And I need you, ah.
All my connections too.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.

The whole world is my throne.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.

All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.

What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
It was all over by a quarter past.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.

But I know that I can't move.
And each one I've never seen again.

But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
I hear them semis rolling too.

Slowly into autumn.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
And the night blows rainy.
It don't matter, anyhow.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Even before you came in the door.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
Remember me to one who lives there.

The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Far down the street we stray.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Blood on your saddle.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.

On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Father of love and father of rain.
Is tearing up your mind.
And it never seemed strange.
Up and down the lonesome town.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
That last night I was with.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
No kindred or relative nigh.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
The hour when the ship comes in.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.

The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
But simply because it's true.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
And make promises by the hours.
Honey, I want you.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.

At my window with a broken wing.
Go lightly on the ground.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Everybody's having them dreams.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
They both rode off together.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
See him at play makes me smile.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
Come on, honey.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
In the border-towns of despair.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Just like you've always smiled before.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
I just go pump on it some.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Is gonna be against the law.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
She's in some foreign land.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
I always thought that he was well.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Without this love that we call ours.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
They complained in the East - they are paying too high.
That's the way I remember her best.
Went into the laundry to wash my clothes down.
And then unto eternity.
Deep down inside, you know, you know - need a whole new beginning.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
The sooner you can leave.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Unless they're from another world.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Yes, tell me.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
I seen a man.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Under the midnight moon.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
I'll hold it down for you.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
If it just don't make me hurts.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
Oh, Angelina.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
My baby took my heart from me.
Know not what the years may hold.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
And no time to think.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he--nobody was glad.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
For the times, they are a-changing.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
On the caboose of the train.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
Leading me, going home.
And left me here facing the wall.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
I'm just average, common too.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Bid farewell forever.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
I'm a poet, I know it.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
I will only let you down.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
That big, old boat started to sink.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
She murdered mortal he.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
I know the kinds of things you like.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Must be and that is all.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Is what this thing here is for.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
It runs both cold and deep.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
I never saw the man again.
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
To see that you're madly in love.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Gal, you're on my mind.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
Heart of mine.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
I want you.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
You're the only love I've ever known.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
I had something to protect.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
And I'll rock you too.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Some speak of the future.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Who says she knows me well.
But I ain't neither one.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
I did not do it knowingly.
When you go your way and I go mine.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Just crying out that he was framed.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
And cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
When he played and we didn't dance.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
Gonna serve somebody.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
You want a watered-down love.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Hmm, tell me.
Duality, mortality.
I took some comfort there.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Havanageeluh.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Most of the time.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
I know they're not what they seem.
Crying out that he was framed.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
Now and forever let it be me.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
While my conscience explodes.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
For as long as love will last.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
I got trouble in my mind.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Looking for the places only they would know.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
This is from the Mojave Desert.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
And relive my dreams.
My baby stole my heart from me.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
And the mailbox is locked.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Rain would gather, too.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
I can't use it anymore.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
Memories of what used to be.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
You can make it too.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
I don't know.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
Baby, baby.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Means another poor boy is underground.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
So quickly into autumn.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
And I want you to be that woman.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
It sure is right on a night like this.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
Figuring a way to get back home.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
And that failure's no success at all.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Everybody must get stoned.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
On this new morning with you.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
Alright, thank you.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
I can't shoot them anymore.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
When I'm alone with you.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Got my mind made up.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Four by four they turn it some more.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
It don't matter anyhow.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
With the golden loom.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
She saw her father's body broken.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
And pretend that we never have touched.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Until I threw it all away.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
I can't see through it anymore.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
God knows...
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
You give something up for everything you gain.
...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
If you won't come out your window.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Adios, mi corazon.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
Crumble into one another.
I see that stationmaster too.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Suffering like a fool.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Lost time is not found again.
High society, notoriety.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
Come on, baby...
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
He's always on trial for just being born.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
And come away with me.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
And old Minu--Mister--et paid for his dream.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
About an old man that never done wrong.
But the mountains of the past.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
And they gotta cut something.
The same as my father before him.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Hope I don't blow it.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
I think this time we should escape.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
So long, honey babe.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Food was flying everywhere - I left without my hat.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
He never did know what it was all about.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Went into a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
They found him dead in the street one day.
That's the day you die.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
You're a big girl all the way.
Alright, thank you very much.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
Step lightly on the ground.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
If'n you don't know by now.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Turned on my record player.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
I'm sick and tired of the war.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Saying wants company.
Epitome, rigidity.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Walking around with no one else.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Baby, please come home.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
We all know for sure that it's real.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
But these to tell what's true.
Neighborhood bully.
What you'll say when you get home.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I just can't beg you anymore.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Where teardrops fall.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
You break your promise all over the place.
I can walk anytime around the block.
This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Mama, you been on my mind.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
That must be what it's all about.
Some place so high above the wall.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
To live it you had to explode.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
At the end of the trail.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
She once was a true love of mine.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
Sound like it's on a final run.
Then the mailman comes in - even he's gotta take a side.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
Honey, baby.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
I'm ready when you are, Senor.
People sleeping in broken beds.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
She can't find him anywhere.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
I'm not the one you need.
Everything inside is made of stone.
But I ain't got Corrina.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
You're on the bottom.
I don't know any more than this.
Everything is broken.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Friends with you.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
Going through all these things twice.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Precious memories flood my soul.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Kisses she gave him three.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
Close your eyes, close the door.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Now you don't talk so loud.
It only brings me sorrow.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Buildings going up to the sky.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
The place that I started from.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Come on, darling.
Crying out that he been framed.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
And your golden loom.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
But with the country to where you're going.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Madams light the candles.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Please let me ride you home.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Nobility, humility.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
And the Santa Fe.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.

Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Than people who are most content.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Tried to create a next world war.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
That keep us so tightly bound.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
The last radio is playing.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
This kind of love, I-I'm lovesick.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
And your highway's getting filled.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
"Get well, get well," said she.
I got nothing to go back to now.
It always does when you're with me.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
In the summertime when you were with me.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
You can show me a new place to start.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Last radio is playing.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
That linger in the fireball heat.
A-lord, protect my child.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here-it's, uh-have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd-I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Our chances really was a million to one.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Till I come into New York town:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Serve somebody:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
His epitaph plain:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
But there's one promise, darling:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Man is opposed to fair play:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Had to be held down by big police;
About everybody that was hanging out;
I find complete love;
All lies and jest;
Everybody that was hanging out;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Crumble into one another;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Make promises by the hour;
So many things that we never will undo;
Some speak of the future;
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Gal, where you been so long?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Why would I want to take your life?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Like a rolling stone?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Oh, so why not you and me?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Am I ready?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
What good am I?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
And one deserving of affection?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Before he can see the sky?
For all these earthly things?
That too many people have died?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
What can I give to You?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Before they're forever banned?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Are you ready?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
How could they let you go?
Across the swooping plain?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you the same person that was here before?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
When he's standing in front of you?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Where did you hide your halo?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Oh, where are you tonight?
What's wrong with you this time?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
How many more can they afford?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
What would life be?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
What else can a poor boy do?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
To love and follow His direction?
Have they missed you?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
How could they ever mistake you?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
And how does it feel?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Across the swamp of time?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Before he can hear people cry?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
How long are we gonna be riding?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
How's everything in heaven?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Of everything you see?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Poor boy, where you been?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Just like a rolling stone?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Ready, George?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
How much poison did they inhale?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Must everybody bow?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't you remember making baby love?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
How does it feel?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Is it rolling, Bob?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
How many more without any reward?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Why must you always try to make me over?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
How can I live for You?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Has anybody seen my love?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Baby, can't you tell?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Too many people have died?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
How come you don't send me no regards?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
What?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can I come home with you?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
What can I do for You?
By golly, what more can I say?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
How many paths did they try and fail?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Who killed Davey Moore?
How many compared to yesterday?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
When did you leave heaven?
Does anyone even try?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Can you get back in?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Why and what's the reason for?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Before you call him a man?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Before they're allowed to be free?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Where did you lose your wings?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
You have to pay to get outta
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
And then you told me later as I apologized
By no special friend
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Nothing was delivered
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
So I'll make my stand
They took a clean-cut kid
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
He was a clean-cut kid
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
As I stand upon the sand
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
There ain't nothing in this world
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
But she ain't gonna find the road
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
I run right home and I went to bed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Just what you had in mind
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Now you don't seem so proud
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Either from the mountains of Madrid
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
And those whom doom and death had spared
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
We live in a political world
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
The changes I was going through can't even be used
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Its iron claws attached
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
You used to be so amused
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Things would be different the next time we wed
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
For what you sold that's not been received
She let go of my hand
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I still can remember the way that you smiled
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
To see him obviously framed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
While some, on principles baptized
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
I will not go down under the ground
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Maybe someday you will understand
I thought that it was well-understood
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
"Equality". I spoke the word
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
How many times can a man turn his head
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And into the path you are hurled
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Now, a very great man once said
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
Standing on the water, casting your bread
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And your trouble is you know it too good
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
You used--be so proud
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
I'll always thank the Lord
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
I've been walking around
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
I want you, baby, just to understand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
All the sweethearts you can hold
I live in another world
Now, whenever I get up and
Somebody seen him hanging around
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
But something has changed
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Silvio, silver and gold
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
But now something has changed
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Many times I've often prayed
And things would be different the next time we wed
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Now you don't act so--so proud
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
It's something you did
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
But all that suffering was not to be compared
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
"It's only you that he does crave
I'm ready for to fade
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
I been wondering all about me
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
And you see why it's so unique to be
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
The crashing waves roll over me
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Up into some paradise
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
To show you something you seen before
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
You could almost think that you're seeing double
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
With all memory and fate
Little did I realize
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
A girl who would murder her own, true love
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
But I can't say I sympathize
Well, it's all new to me
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
But the dark does die
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
So I look like a walking mountain range
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Though its shadow's metal badge
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
And suddenly there appeared before me
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Well, six white horses that you did promise
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
I can survive and I can endure
Full of hope and desire
You said you'd never compromise
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
A bed that is never mine
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
What good am I then to others and me
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
But I feel nothing for their game
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
As he rises to fame
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
On the rising curve
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
You into thinking you're the one
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Should I leave them by your gate
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Limited in sex they dare
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Hunger pays a heavy price
And I ain't complaining none
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Says it's closing time
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
We see this empty cage now corrode
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And her silver-studded phantom cause
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
She been gone
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
There were times when I was so lonesome
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
To give the special one you seek a chance
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
What about that millionaire
The cause was there before we came
I am homeless, come and take me
Among the lovely people living free
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
So up she picked her babies three
How many ears must one man have
And plenty time for good romance
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Should I put them by your gate
At dawn my lover comes to me
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Lies that life is black-and-white
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Everybody's wearing a disguise
And I would send a message
What you're gonna say when you get home
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Knows there's no success like failure
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Just pick anyone
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
It's all new to me
Just what you will say when you get home
I rode with him in a taxi once
Remember me to the one who lives there
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
You smiling through the fence at me
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
You say you're looking for someone
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
You know, it's not even safe no more
Mona tried to tell me
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
You just pick anyone
I don't even notice she gone
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
But I can get another one
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
And the Negro's name
They say don't come back no more
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
I do declare
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
While them that defend what they cannot see
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
She plunged him into well water where
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
When the rain is blowing in your face
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
And never sat once at the head of the table
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
He'll see by his grave
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
"Oh, father, you will surely die
She knows there's no success like failure
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
So I remember every face
Remember me to one who lives there
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
The man the authorities came to blame
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
If dogs run free, why not we
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
So, I called up the operator of time
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Better stay away from those
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Leaving men wholly, totally free
How was I to know you'd be the one
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
What's probably got you baffled more
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Waiting to find out what price
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
And that is that one must always flush out his house
You're not free to belong to me
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
If dogs run free, why not me
From all the plans they do pursue
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
If dogs run free, then what must be
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
When I'm all alone
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
All I feel is heat and flame
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
That she's the same one
You cut to the core
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
It'll be with me unto the grave
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Taking care of somebody nice
"That I might be gone a long, old time
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
From the start by the rule
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
When the roses fade
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
But then a whistle will be blowing
Where the time and the tempo drag
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
There's nothing in here moving
And the cards are no good that you're holding
'Cause the battle outside raging
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Early in the morning, early in the morning
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
For your weary toes to be touching
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
You left me standing in the doorway crying
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was a-snarling
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
The order is rapidly fading
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
The order is a-rapidly fading
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Deceived me into thinking
And there's no telling who that it's naming
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
For your weary toes to be a-touching
It's not a bad way to make a living
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Beyond here lies nothing
The battle outside raging
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
They're drinking up and walking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
She rode by night and came by morning
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
If I was with her too long
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Then she told us how times were tough
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And how I know I'll make it through
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Look out, the saints are coming through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I have fallen far beneath
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
You go north and you go south
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Well, there ain't no going back
I wish she'd unlock
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
You turn around to take a final peek
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
The man in me will do nearly any task
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
But they caught him and they brought him back
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Her voice once and talk
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Shoot in the back
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
And if my love is real
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
How does it feel
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
To make all that should be killed to crawl
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
How many seas must the white dove sail
Ring bell, hard to tell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
All and all can only fall
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
He's taught in his school
I chased me a woman up the hill
They ask me how I feel
Oh, how does it feel
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
A girl by the whirlpool
A-how does it feel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
He's sure got a lot of gall
Then why don't she tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
As the last fire-truck from hell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Ring bar, hard to tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Muttering small talk at the wall
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
How many seas must a white dove sail
Soul to soul our shadows roll
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
But I can hear another drum
Two eyes took the aim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
And remain as I am
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
You better not chew gum
"For you cannot relive them
Now, they asked me to read a poem
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
You take just like a woman
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
And all their daughters put me down
All their daughters put me down
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
And she aches just like a woman
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And there's no exit in any direction
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Must meet the dawn
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Guns and clubs followed him down
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
My love, she's like some raven
You don't need a weatherman
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
How many roads must a man walk down
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
She got such a sweet disposition
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Trying to get a lead on
Advertising signs that con
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
You need something to make it known
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Poor boy in a red-hot town
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Why did you trade heaven
She takes just like a woman
Out of the shower comes a football man
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Their religion of the little ten women
The ones that jump on the wagon
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
There was little to say, there was no conversation
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
But I swear I see my reflection
How can the life of such a man
To remember the times when I was your only man
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
All lay down their bandanas and complain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
A-she takes just like a woman
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
In the pigpen
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
The next morning she had awoken
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Well, you fake just like a woman
Suicide remarks are torn
Somebody new to beat on
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
But all their daughters put me down
But the second mother was with the seventh son
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Have died in battle or in vain
As you sit on the box you keep him in
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
But it's hard to think on
That long, black train is pulling down
Nothing we can call our own
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
For the loser now will be later to win
The foreign sun, it squints upon
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
And the corner sign
"Not me," said the gambling man
Darkness at the break of noon
As they rode him in custody down to the station
I don't even care if I ever see her again
For the loser now might be later to win
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Yet I swear I see my reflection
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
She said that all the railroad men
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
To my knowledge there's just one man
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
From heights that they could not gain
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
He got that fortress on the mountain
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Well, I'm hanging on
And you ache a-just like a woman
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
But me, I expected it to happen
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
I'll be waiting at the station
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
That long, black train is pulling on down
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Yes, and someone must explain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
I figure maybe we're even
But the post office has been stolen
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
And she wakes just like a woman
Silvio, I gotta go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Every place I wanna go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
All I'd like you to do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
There's nothing you can say or do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
All I really wanna do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
There is a place you go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
How many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
The man in the coon-skin cap
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Man in the coon-skin cap
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Aladdin and his lamp
What good am I while you softly weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
I walked down there and ended up
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
At any moment you could go under
She took him by his long, yellow hair
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
When you whispered in my ear
When only you are near
I close my eyes and I wonder
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
In one I was running and in another
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
So, don't fear if you hear
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
Still I've always kind of missed her
Still I say her love-words over
But morning is clear
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
My ship is in the harbor
And I don't even think about her
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Never no more do I wonder
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
For I am married to a house carpenter
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I don't have to go far
Alone you stand with nobody near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
All you boys better run for cover
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
The wind howls like a hammer
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I could feel a whole lot better
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
I say, "Why you say that for
The face of God will appear
Who came here from Cuba's door
The lover who has just walked out your door
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
You heard me saying a prayer for
For all eternity I think I will remember
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
With a big bouquet of the roses
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Girl by the whirlpool's
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Don't wear sandals
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
They whisper in the wings
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Six-time users
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
At times I think there are no words
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
To sharpen the senses
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Now, you must provide some answers
Seven days
I try to tell it like it is
What good am I if I say foolish things
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
The cowboy angel rides
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
And, though the masters make the rules
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
I was thinking of a series of dreams
And tells me of her dreams
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Good and bad, I define these terms
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
You can fall down on your knees
How many deaths will it take till he knows
On the back of the fish truck that loads
And so Patty calls the cops
And without further notice asks you how it feels
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
I'd gladly confess
But, though the masters make the rules
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
And then complains
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
I'm gonna let you pass
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Well, the ragman draws circles
Thinking of a series of dreams
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
When your mother sends back all your invitations
You should be made to wear earphones
You been hurt so many times
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Glide across the lonely years
Don't follow leaders
He's not selling any alibis
And your father, to your sister he explains
You know that he has no intentions
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
People carry roses
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
To the cutting of fences
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Wants eleven dollar bills
"Not me," said the man whose fists
And I try to harmonize with songs
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
The empty-handed painter from your streets
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
I let it slip gladly to my friends
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And the poor white remains
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Romantic facts of musketeers
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
But still remains
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
People on the platforms
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
That it's you and no one else that owns
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
As friends and other strangers
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
To memorizing politics
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
You never turned around to see the frowns
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
We living in times when men commit crimes
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Statues made of matchsticks
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Her window's wide open, African trees
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
True love can make a blade of grass
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
And the princess and the prince discuss
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Six-time losers
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
To hold each other tight
You used to laugh about
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Plants in the bed, but
Wait for the morning light
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
And I, in my armor, turning about
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
How many years can a mountain exist
They tell me revenge is sweet
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Talking that the heat put
Keep me set apart
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
One more night the moon is shining bright
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
You don't forget
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Keep it in your mind and not forget
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Everything is always right
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
But, if the arrow is straight
You're gonna get hit
One more night I will wait for the light
Someday, everything is gonna be different
I think that it's best
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
The slowest now will later be fast
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Without any doubt
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Like a corkscrew to my heart
He built a fire on Main Street
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Everyone still talks about
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Every new messenger bringing evil report
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
I'm moving after midnight
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
So he never thinks straight
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
There's some people that
I'm on the pavement
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Johnny's in the basement
By the way, that's a cute hat
You are there in the flickering light
We can hold up a toast if we meet
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
You used to laugh-make fun about
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
I got into the driver's seat
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
With your pockets well protected at last
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
The slow one now will later be fast
In the precious winds they rot
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
You're hearing my heart beat
She seems too far out
It don't take too long to find out
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Ain't it hard when you discover that
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
And the first one now will later be last
And, since my feet are now fast
Well, I finally started thinking straight
How many years can some people exist
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
That might be all that you got
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
In the stillness of the midnight
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
They tell me to be discreet
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
He really wasn't where it's at
To keep it in your mind and not forget
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
I soon get some rest
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
And I tell this truth to you
To protect you and defend you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
To be alone with you
I just might have to come see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
I can be just like you
It's just crazy being here with you
I'll remember you
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Don't it always go to show
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Down every street there's a window
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
I'd sure like to know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
He been living there three years now
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Well, I'd sure like to know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
The only one I know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
But sooner or later one of us must know
Sooner or later one of us must know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
With only you in view
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
It only goes to show
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Now, you're probably wondering by now
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always a-go to show
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
My mind weaves a symphony
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
For them that think death--death's honesty
We banged the drum slowly
But I wish there was something you would do or say
So, I'm walking down your highway
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
The same thing I would want today
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Maggie says that many say
And the only tune my guitar could play
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
If I don't take the chance to try
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
From phony jealousy
She puts it to me plain as day
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Is worth more than I could pay
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
That I was just a puppet in a play
For them that must obey authority
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
She knocked upon it anyway
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Well, I saw it advertised one day
And it's up to you to say
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
But I can't deny
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
He made the bells of freedom ring today
I send you all my money
Spouted out that liberty
So I run down most hurriedly
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
She starts to speak, but he walks away
For them that think death's honesty
A cock is crowing far away
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And I'm leaving every day to run away
And the ladies treat me kindly
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Went to the doctor the very next day
And for His love they took His life away
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Don't you tell Henry
Or if you just want some company
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
I did not do it harmfully
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
My ears hear a symphony
To those condemned to act accordingly
Though I'd never say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
The Spanish-American War had its day
No, you'll not now or no other day
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
But you can never steal away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
That I done it the way
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
So they took him to the infirmary
She smiles, walks the other way
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
And that which you've given me today
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
