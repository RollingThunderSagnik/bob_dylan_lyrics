# How to Contribute

## Installing Git

- There are a number of ways to contribute. You might want to alter the lyrics of a song, modify the information about authorship, etc. The first thing to do is to install Git. If you're on Linux, Git might already be installed, but if not follow the directions below. To find out if Git is installed, just try running the `git --version` command in a terminal. If Git is installed, you will see a message about what version is installed. Any version should work fine.

### Installing on Linux/Mac

- Depending on what Linux distribution you are running, you will have to run something like the following (with administrative privileges): `sudo yum install git-all` or `sudo apt-get install git-all`. If you do not have administrative privileges, you could clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/git/git) and follow the installation instructions in order to install it in a location that is owned by you. This would take some knowledge of Linux to do successfully. If unsure, feel free to [email me](mailto:mulhodm@gmail.com). The instructions that I give below will specifically be for running commands in a command-line interface, but a GUI should provide functionality that roughly maps to the commands, so it is possible to make changes using a GUI.

- If on OSX, try to follow the instructions for Mac [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Installing on Windows

- Follow the instructions for Windows [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). There are a few different options for installing Git as a graphical user interface (GUI) or as a command-line interface (though a command-line interface is often provided as a capability by GUI installations). The instructions that I give below will specifically be for running commands in a command-line interface, but GUIs should provide functionality that roughly maps to the commands, so it is possible to make changes using a GUI.
