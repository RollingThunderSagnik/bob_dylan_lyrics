# The Lyrics of Bob Dylan

- The website can be found [here](http://mulhod.github.io/bob_dylan_lyrics/index.html)
- More info to come later, including how to submit a "patch", i.e., how to collaborate and propose changes/additions to the site (there will be a screenshot tutorial, hopefully)
- If interested in contributing to/making use of the code, you can either run the `setup_conda_env_and_install.sh` script to automatically build a virtual environment named `dylan_lyrics` (make sure to have `conda` installed) or either manually create a virtual environment and then run the `setup.py` script (as is done in `setup_conda_env_and_install.sh`) from within the environment or just run `python setup.py install` from the root directory of this repository (after cloning it).
